                        "title": "Betting Strategy: How to Bet NFL Underdogs",
                        "content": "<p>When it comes to sports betting, especially for NFL picks, there are two teams on the field. One team is going to be stronger than the other. That team is the favorite because they are favored to win. The other squad that may not be as good is called the underdog.<\/p><p>Betting underdogs can be profitable in certain cases. Below, we\u2019ll explain how to bet NFL underdogs whether it\u2019s a Monday Night Football game, a Thursday nighter, a Sunday day game\u00a0or the Super Bowl.<\/p><h2>Underdogs and the NFL Point Spread<\/h2><p>In order to even the betting field, oddsmakers \u2013 the people who set the odds so you can make your picks \u2013 give the underdog an advantage through the point spread. Let\u2019s say the Tampa Bay Buccaneers are playing the New Orleans Saints. NFL spread odds would look something like this:<\/p><p>Saints -7.5<\/p><p>Bucs +7.5<\/p><p>In this NFL betting scenario, the Saints are the favorite. In order for them to cover the spread, they would need to win by eight points or more. Conversely, the Bucs would need to win outright or not lose by more than seven points to cover.<\/p><p>Most NFL bettors would see these odds and take New Orleans to cover because they assume that Drew Brees is going to do what he does best, and connect with every receiver he can. His accuracy is near perfect, so it would make sense for you to lean toward\u00a0the favorite on this bet.<\/p><p>However, if a metaphorical wrench were to be thrown before the game, and Brees comes down with the flu, there is a strong possibility that won\u2019t play. In this case, a bet on Tampa Bay, aka the underdog, could prove to be very profitable. Since they only need to win the game straight up or not lose by more than seven points to cover, there is a strong chance that they\u2019ll do exactly that.<\/p><h2>Betting Value with Home Underdogs<\/h2><p>There is some debate over home-field advantage and just how important it is when making your NFL betting picks. Here at Handspit, we believe that there is some worth in betting the lesser team at home on certain occasions. The value with home underdogs comes with digging deeper when handicapping their games by examining situational and motivational betting angles.<\/p><h3>Schedule<\/h3><p>A team\u2019s schedule is everything. Underdogs playing their second straight game at home are generally more comfortable and focused than in their previous game. They haven\u2019t had to travel in nearly two weeks, meaning more time spent in their own home, in their own beds, without the stresses of being on the road. More importantly, they don\u2019t have to worry about entering a different time zone.<\/p><h3>Previous Loss<\/h3><p>In a league where any team can win on any given day, sometimes how much energy a team has can be the deciding factor. In addition, these home dogs tend to be even more dangerous if they lost in front of their fans the week before. No team wants to be embarrassed in front of their home crowd twice in a row, especially in such a high-profile league.<\/p><p>No travel, combined with added motivation, makes home underdogs coming off a home loss extremely dangerous. An example would be the New England Patriots, who seem to have trouble losing two games in a row. Since 2001, when Tom Brady became the starting quarterback, the Pats have dominated their opponent coming off a defeat. They\u2019ve only surrendered 12 games after a beating. Considering they\u2019ve won multiple Super Bowls, they are rarely given underdog status, no matter which team they\u2019re up against. This doesn\u2019t mean you should blindly back any home team coming off a loss, but you should do your homework and see what their record is when they\u2019re playing on their own turf.<\/p><h3>The Noise Factor when Facing a Division Rival<\/h3><p>Familiarity breeds contempt, and that is clear when divisional rivals face each other in the NFL. Facing off two times a year every season, division foes tend to hate each other, and play tough physical games against one another. Furthermore, crowds really get into it and hiss their hearts out every time the rival touches the ball. This is especially true late in the season when the road favorite has something on the line, and the home dog has the opportunity to play spoiler. Booing and chanting an opposing player\u2019s name can be a huge distraction for the visiting team, leaving the home dog primed for victory. The underdog could pull off the upset and cover the spread, or win the game outright to win your moneyline bet, regardless of the talent discrepancy between the two teams.<\/p><p>Seattle is a great example of a divisional rivalry turning into an underdog win. CenturyLink Field is so loud that even top favorites have struggled when visiting the Seahawks. In 2013, the stadium earned the Guinness World Record for Loudest Roar at a Sports Stadium with 137.6 decibels. Noise can ruin a great team and turn a bad team into a winner.<\/p><h2>Betting Value with Road Underdogs<\/h2><p>We just explained why you should back a home dog, and odds are\u00a0you\u2019ve been scared of NFL underdogs when they\u2019re on the road. However, there is hidden value in taking a road dog sometimes. Let\u2019s pretend the Kansas City Chiefs are facing off against the Los Angeles Rams. Moneyline odds would look something like so:<\/p><p>Rams -250<\/p><p>Chiefs +150<\/p><p>At betting sites, favorite odds always have a minus sign (-) in front of them. Underdog odds always have a plus sign (+) in front of them. In this case, we\u2019ll say that LA is playing at home, making KC the visitor. However, the Chiefs have been on a tear lately, crushing opponents. The Rams are also doing quite well but have found themselves with an injured star running back and a quarterback who is limping. Both are playing, but they can\u2019t give their all. Los Angeles is still the favorite, yet Kansas City is healthy and won its last game. In this case, you would look into betting on KC even though the Chiefs are\u00a0the road dog.<\/p><p>Whether it\u2019s a game between the worst team in the league and the best team, there is handicapping information available to help you make your bet. As long as you check out Handspit\u2019s football pages when making your picks, you\u2019ll know when it\u2019s worth it to bet NFL underdogs.<\/p>"

                        "content": "<p>The NFL regular season is often centered on sides and totals, but with every betting site offering a slew of different wagering types, props are becoming the go-to bet every Sunday, Monday, Thursday, and some Saturdays in December. Instead of making a traditional point spread bet or moneyline wager, why not try your hand at something a little more entertaining?<\/p><p>Making NFL prop bets requires skill and a little handicapping. Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re here to help. Handspit\u2019s got you covered like the Patriots in the red zone.<\/p><h2>What is a Prop Bet?<\/h2><p>A prop bet is a wager that typically has nothing to do with the outcome of a game. NFL prop bets can be anything from how an individual player performs, how long the national anthem will be, which team will win the coin toss (more on that below) and even how many penalties a team will get.<\/p><p>Prop is short for \u201cproposition\u201d and these are bets that are generally made for entertainment purposes. Let\u2019s use the example of Drew Brees, quarterback of the New Orleans Saints and future Hall of Famer. At your betting site of choice, prop bets for this type of player would be something like:<\/p><p>\u2022 How many touchdowns will he throw in the Saints\u2019 game against the Falcons?<\/p><p>\u2022 How many passing yards will he have in the first quarter of a game against the Panthers?<\/p><p>\u2022 Will he throw an interception against the Buccaneers?<\/p><h2>How to Read NFL Prop Bet Odds<\/h2><p>When you visit any online sportsbook, you\u2019ll find prop odds. Depending on the type of NFL props you\u2019re looking to make, the odds will look something like this:<\/p><p>Will Player X announce his retirement in the postgame interview?<\/p><p>Yes +500<\/p><p>No -1000<\/p><p>For this scenario, let\u2019s pretend that a star player is turning 45 and isn\u2019t moving as quickly as he used to. There are rumors that he is going to retire at some point during the 2019 NFL season. Oddsmakers hear the same buzz that we do and will create props based on that information.<\/p><p>If you believe that Player X is going to announce his retirement after the game you\u2019re betting on, you would choose Yes. Let\u2019s say you lay down $25 and he does end his playing career. You would get a payout of $150 \u2013 your $25 comes back along with your winnings of $125. On the other hand, a winning $25 No bet would get you $27.50 \u2013 your original amount is returned plus the $2.50 that you won. Our Odds Calculator can help you determine how much you\u2019d win based on the amount you bet.<\/p><p>In this case the Yes would be a riskier bet with a higher payoff because of the plus sign (+). A No bet comes with less risk and a smaller win due to the minus sign (-). This is the same as a traditional moneyline bet where you have a favorite and an underdog. In this case there is no fave (-) or dog (+) but the same symbols to signify which bet is riskier.<\/p><h2>Super Bowl Props<\/h2><p>Football\u2019s biggest game creates a prop betting frenzy. Sportsbooks will provide you with countless options that go beyond what you\u2019d get during the regular NFL season.<\/p><p>\u2022 Anthem: For the Super Bowl, the NFL goes all out and gets a huge recording artist to perform the anthem. You can make a prop bet on how long it will take to sing the Star Spangled Banner.<\/p><p>\u2022 Coin Toss: You have a 50 percent chance of winning this bet which also means that you have a 50 percent chance of losing. The result is completely random and something you can\u2019t research, but it\u2019s still a fun prop to make.<\/p><p>\u2022 Gatorade Color: As is tradition, the winning team dumps an entire Gatorade dispenser on their coach. You can bet on what color the sports drink will be.<\/p><p>\u2022 Player Props: An example of a player prop would be: Who will be Super Bowl MVP?<\/p><h2>Live Betting<\/h2><p>As your sports betting prowess improves, you can make more advanced NFL prop bets. Since props are considered the more entertaining bets you can make on any regular-season game, the better you get at betting, the easier it is to find value in other prop wagers. Why not try something more advanced like live betting?<\/p><p>If you\u2019ve been following a particular team and know their tendencies, this is a great way to uncover NFL football props that have more significance. Keep an eye on the weekly injury reports and latest game matchups and you could find major value on betting while the game is in progress. In-play betting allows you to bet on things like which team will score first after halftime, or if the next play will end in a field goal.<\/p><p>Another rule of thumb for live betting is to evaluate the spread and see a team\u2019s ATS standings. In a blowout, the team that\u2019s leading tends to run the ball to milk the clock like a dairy cow, while the trailing squad tends to up the air attack like a scene from Top Gun. The score of the game has a direct effect on statistical output, so handicap your bets accordingly.<\/p><p>Live odds will appear during regular-season games, but not all betting sites offer them during the postseason.<\/p><h2>How to Maximize your NFL Proposition Bets<\/h2><p>There are things you can do to boost your bankroll when betting NFL team and player props. Stick to what you know well and make sure what you\u2019re betting on can be researched \u2013 our Handspit NFL pages can help with this. We have free picks, odds, scores, betting trends, consensus and pretty much everything you\u2019ll need to research the particular prop bet you\u2019re looking to make, whether you\u2019re looking at regular-season National Football League odds or fun Super Bowl bets.<\/p>"

                        "content": "<p>Betting on a football game isn\u2019t just limited to the whole game as wagers can also be placed on a given team at halftime to win the remainder of the game or cover the spread\/total for the second half. Oddsmakers shift the line\/spread throughout the contest and it\u2019s up to bettors to determine at halftime if they want to pounce on the adjusted odds.<\/p><h2>How to Bet on a Halftime Line<\/h2><p>Halftime betting is available at online sportsbooks with spreads\/lines on the second half typically available at the end or near the end of the first half. As there is usually a short window before play resumes, bettors will need to make a quick judgment call on which team will be the best bet before play resumes.<\/p><h2>What to Consider when Betting on a Halftime Line<\/h2><p>When betting a halftime line, focus on key elements of what transpired in the opening half.<\/p><p>Were injuries a factor? Did penalties and\/or turnovers have a major effect on the score and\/or total? Does one team have significant momentum? Did one team just have a bad or uncharacteristically great first half? To what extent did the respective game plans play out? Are one or both teams already adjusting to the opponent\u2019s game plan? Is wind, rain or snow starting to influence the game? These are all questions that need to be considered before wagering on a halftime line.<\/p><p>Remember: Both sides \u2013 you and the sportsbook \u2013 have an advantage. You\u2019ve seen the game, and the book has time on their side. It\u2019s a good idea to take notes throughout the first half and to have the computer ready to look at the hard numbers in relation to your observations.<\/p><p>Halftime lines also give bettors a chance to double down on their winnings or hedge their bet. Did you bet the underdog on the spread, only to cheer as they took an outright lead after the first half? A smart halftime wager coupled with your initial bet could see you reap some serious profit.<\/p>"

                        "content": "<p>Spreads and moneylines are still all the rage in NFL betting. But, season win totals are gaining popularity among\u00a0football bettors since they allow you to predict how many wins your favorite team will get when the regular season is done.<\/p><p>You don\u2019t even have to bet on your favorite team, you can find betting value and great odds on squads you hate. Not everyone is a New England Patriots fan; however, you could net some major coin by betting on their season win totals. There are 32 teams in the NFL and correctly guessing how many victories at least one squad will put up during the season can put some money in your pocket and impress your friends with your ability to beat the odds.<\/p><h2>How to Bet NFL Win Totals<\/h2><p>NFL season win totals are similar to a traditional OVER\/UNDER bet except instead of betting on a single game, you\u2019re betting on all 16 of them at once.<\/p><p>For instance, a traditional totals bet involves you deciding if the total number of points scored by both teams will go OVER or UNDER the oddsmaker\u2019s set number. Let\u2019s say the Los Angeles Rams are playing the New Orleans Saints and the total is set at 58.5. You would pick the OVER if you think the total points will be 59 or more, or the UNDER if you think it will be 58 or less.<\/p><p>For season win totals the odds would look something like this:<\/p><p>Chicago Bears 9.5<\/p><p>OVER -130<\/p><p>UNDER +105<\/p><p>If you believe that the Bears \u2013 excuse us, Da Bears! \u2013 will win 10 games or more, you would bet the OVER. If you think they\u2019ll win nine or less, you would take the UNDER.<\/p><p>A winning $150 OVER bet would give you a payout of $265.38 \u2013 your original $150 is returned along with your prize of $115.38. If you were to bet that same $150 on the UNDER and Chicago won nine or fewer games, you\u2019d get a payout of $307.50 \u2013 you get your $150 back coupled with your earnings of $157.50.<\/p><h2>Handicapping NFL Season Win Totals<\/h2><p>Handicapping is all about looking both ways, like when you\u2019re crossing the street. You\u2019ll need to look to the past and the future to decide if you want to bet the OVER or the UNDER. You can win big money on this type of wager if you do your homework. You\u2019ll also need to ask yourself the following questions:<\/p><p>Is this a team on the rise or the decline?<\/p><p>What does their schedule look like? Are they up against the best in the league?<\/p><p>Have they signed any key free agents or made coaching changes?<\/p><p>Are they a team that tends to be overvalued by the betting public?<\/p><p>First, take a step back and evaluate a team\u2019s previous campaign. If you don\u2019t know what happened last season, you\u2019ll be in over your head this season. Did they get lucky last season? Did they punch above their numbers based on scoring margin and offensive and defensive rankings? On the other side of the coin, were they unlucky and\/or the victims of a tough schedule or injury problems?<\/p><p>Let\u2019s break it down further and explore each factor involved in handicapping your season win totals in detail.<\/p><h3>Free Agency<\/h3><p>Have unrestricted free agents re-signed with their team or have they moved on? What about restricted free agents? Have they accepted their current club\u2019s offer or are they looking at other options for more money? If a team loses a powerful player, odds are\u00a0it can affect their season win totals.<\/p><h3>Training Camps<\/h3><p>Is a player holding out like Darrelle Revis did in 2010? The cornerback \u2013 considered at the time\u00a0one of the league\u2019s best \u2013 missed the majority of training camp, yet it didn\u2019t keep the Jets from recording 11 wins that season. On the other hand, Le\u2019Veon Bell\u2019s 2018 holdout with the Steelers turned the team into a sideshow and may have even caused them to miss the playoffs.<\/p><h3>Offense\/Defense<\/h3><p>A strong offensive line scores touchdowns, while a strong defensive line prevents the other team from scoring them. Injuries to any player on either line, without a solid backup waiting in the wings, will hinder a team from winning games.<\/p><h3>Schedule<\/h3><p>A lax schedule will keep a team on top, whereas a string of games against tougher squads will hamper its\u00a0on-field performance. Let\u2019s say the Dallas Cowboys have an easy schedule that sees them playing lesser teams. This will increase their win totals. However, if they have a rough road ahead of them where they\u2019ll face off against tougher squads, their win odds decrease significantly. Moreover, a team will play the other three teams in its division twice per season. So, if their division is stacked with unbeatable teams, it will affect their totals.<\/p><h3>Last Game of the Regular Season<\/h3><p>During the preseason, teams may not start their star players in favor of giving backups and new players a chance to show their coaches what they can do. NFL season win totals do not encompass the preseason. But, the last few games of the regular season do count. For example, Bill Belichick may sit Tom Brady for the second half of their last regular-season game to give his celebrated QB some rest. Now, a team like the Patriots has\u00a0shown time and time again that even if Tommy stays on the bench for a quarter or two, they can still win games. Conversely, a team like the Miami Dolphins may not win their last game if they sit their starters, especially if they\u2019re playing the Patriots.<\/p><h3>Mind the Gap<\/h3><p>Once you have those elements figured out, look at the gap between last season\u2019s finish and this season\u2019s win total. How sizable is the difference? Can they win more games or are they primed for a setback?<\/p><p>Let\u2019s say the Kansas City Chiefs had a great year and won 11 games. This year, their win total is set at 11.5. If they haven\u2019t had any major personnel changes and their squad is healthy going into the season, that half-game gap isn\u2019t a big deal. However, if the total is set at 8.5, that\u2019s a Grand Canyon-sized gap. You\u2019ll have to look at the other factors we\u2019ve listed above to figure out why there\u2019s such a huge difference between this year and last year\u2019s win totals and why the odds seem to be against them.<\/p><h2>Futures vs Season Win Totals<\/h2><p>When it comes to making long-term NFL bets, futures are very popular. Like season win totals, futures are bets on events that will happen once the season is done. These two betting types are very similar in the sense that your money will be tied up while the season is going on. For instance, in August, you could bet that the Green Bay Packers will win the Super Bowl. If this comes true, you\u2019ll only be able to collect your winnings once the big game is played. The same goes for season win totals. You\u2019ll need to wait until the last game before the playoffs begin to get paid.<\/p><h2>Setting the Totals Number<\/h2><p>Keep in mind that a listed season win total isn\u2019t a prediction by oddsmakers done willy-nilly. This number is decided by looking into a team\u2019s past performance and offseason moves \u2013 the same way you would handicap your win totals bet. The only other factor that bookmakers add to their decision when setting the totals number is betting interest. They need to create an even betting field to attract equal action on both the OVER and UNDER. If bettors were only taking the OVER, sportsbooks wouldn\u2019t be able to make payouts and they\u2019d go out of business.<\/p><h2>Ready to Make Your NFL Win Totals Bet?<\/h2><p>Now that you have the tools to make your first bet, visit one of our top picks for NFL betting sites.

                        "content": "<p>Knowing how to wager on football is an important part of \u2026 betting on football. Every Sunday, Monday, Thursday and some Saturdays, people across the world are studying betting trends and looking for betting lines at various sportsbooks so they can place their NFL bets and hopefully make some coin.<\/p><p>Placing bets throughout the football season can be a fun and lucrative endeavor, especially if you put a little effort into it. Luckily, we\u2019ll do the heavy lifting \u2013\u2013 so all you have to do is read this page and you\u2019ll have a greater understanding of how to bet NFL games from the preseason to the Super Bowl, whether you\u2019re looking at live odds or traditional betting lines.<\/p><h2>Understanding NFL Betting Lines and Odds<\/h2><p>Before you learn how NFL betting works, you\u2019ll need to understand how to read odds. Typically, odds for a football game would look like this:<\/p><p>New Orleans Saints -7 (-110)<\/p><p>Atlanta Falcons +7 (+110)<\/p><p>This means that the Saints are favored over the Falcons by 7 points. At the sportsbook, favorites are always listed with a minus (-) and underdogs have the plus sign (+)<\/p><p>NFL betting sites need to make their money, which is why they take a cut of your bet. Called the vig or the juice, this is the percentage of money from each bet that the sportsbook gets. This is generally three\u00a0to 20 percent but can go higher depending on the type of bet and online sportsbook you\u2019re using to bet with. You\u2019ll see this number next to the odds in brackets.<\/p><h2>NFL Betting Types<\/h2><p>When you want to bet on football, there are different types of bets you can make. Each offers bettors a chance to win some money at the sportsbook if you\u2019re able to make smart picks \u2013 and Handspit will help with that.<\/p><h3>Moneyline<\/h3><p>A moneyline bet is when you pick which team you think will win the game outright. It\u2019s often called a straight-up bet\u00a0at the sportsbook because moneyline betting involves you choosing one squad to win over the other. Since there are skill discrepancies between the two teams, betting the team more likely to win will come at a premium, aka less risk.<\/p><p>For example, if the Pittsburgh Steelers visit the New England Patriots, odds would look something like this:<\/p><p>Pats -160<\/p><p>Steelers +140<\/p><p>A $100 winning bet on New England would give you $162.50 \u2013 your original $100 comes back along with your winnings of $62.50. On the other hand, if you laid down that same amount of money on Pittsburgh and they won, you\u2019d get $240 \u2013 your $100 is returned along with your winnings of $140.<\/p><p>Betting on underdogs, in this case Big Ben\u2019s squad, is considered a riskier bet, but you get a bigger reward. Conversely, betting the favorite is less risky, which means it comes with less reward.<\/p><p>To find out how much you\u2019d win based on what you bet, check out our Odds Calculator.<\/p><h3>Point Spread<\/h3><p>A point spread in sports is a figure made by odds specialists to provide an advantage or disadvantage based on the margin of victory or defeat for a given NFL team. The favorite team would be at the disadvantage as they would need to win the game by a certain number of points, while the underdog would be given an advantage to not lose the game by a set number of points or to win outright.<\/p><p>An example of spread betting would be the Philadelphia Eagles as a -3.5 favorite against the Dallas Cowboys, who are listed as +3.5 underdogs. Bettors who take the Eagles \u2013 or Iggles, as they say in Philly \u2013 would need them to win by four or more points to cover the spread. Bettors who take the Cowboys would need them to win outright or lose by three\u00a0points or less, otherwise they will not have covered the spread.<\/p><p>A strong\u00a0team like the Green Bay Packers would see a huge spread when playing a less than stellar team like the Detroit Lions. In cases like that, the Packers would be a heavy fave with spread odds of something like -16.5. That means they\u2019d have to beat the Lions by 17 or more points.<\/p><h3>Totals<\/h3><p>The total in any given football event is a combined final score of both teams. The total is set by oddsmakers based on how they envision a game will unfold from a scoring perspective. This type of bet is also called an OVER\/UNDER bet. As a bettor, you would need to select if the final score will be OVER or UNDER the set total.<\/p><p>Typically, you would handicap a totals bet by looking at certain variables like:<\/p><p>\u2022 Offensive and Defensive stats<\/p><p>\u2022 Injuries<\/p><p>\u2022 The weather (high winds + kicker = heartbreak)<\/p><p>\u2022 Team Reports <\/p><p>\u2022 Game Logs<\/p><p>\u2022 Standings <\/p><p>\u2022 Power Rankings <\/p><p>\u2022 Betting Trends <\/p><p>\u2022 Consensus<\/p><p>For example, let\u2019s take a Seahawks vs Raiders matchup with the total set at 48.5 points. As a bettor, you would select if the game\u2019s final score will be OVER 48.5 points or UNDER 48.5 points. So, if the game ended 27-20 for Oakland, that would combine to 47 points, meaning the game went UNDER.<\/p><p>Sometimes you\u2019ll see a totals betting line that does not have half a point. Let\u2019s say for the same matchup, the total is set at 49 and the combined score ends up hitting it on the nose. That\u2019s called a PUSH. Should this happen, you get your money back because technically you didn\u2019t win or lose.<\/p><h3>Futures<\/h3><p>We can\u2019t go back to the future, but we can bet on it. A futures bet is made on events that could happen by the end of the NFL season. You can bet on everything from which team will win its division to\u00a0which team will come first in its conference\u00a0and which player will be named MVP.<\/p><h3>Props<\/h3><p>NFL prop bets are like a game within the game that many bettors play solely for the entertainment factor. Props on individual performances like passing yards, rushing yards and receiving yards are some examples of this kind of bet. You will also find props available for the Super Bowl on the length of the national anthem, the result of the coin toss, and the color of Gatorade that will be used to drench the winning coach at the end of the game.<\/p><h3>Parlays<\/h3><p>A parlay is when you make multiple picks like a moneyline, spread, and totals bet in separate games but on one single ticket. In order to win your parlay, you would need all bets to hit.<\/p><p>You can also select two events to occur within the same game for a correlated parlay. For instance, you can take the Cleveland Browns to cover the spread at +10 against the Cincinnati Bengals and add an UNDER bet for that game too.<\/p><h3>Teasers<\/h3><p>If parlays are the full-flavored regular Coke of sports betting, teasers are the Diet Coke of NFL wagering. Like a parlay, you would need all your bets to hit to win your ticket; however, you get to adjust the point spread or totals line to lower your risk level. Same great taste, with less calories. Teasers often start at 6 points and can go as high as 15 points depending on the betting site.<\/p><h3>Live Betting<\/h3><p>In-play betting is when you wager on a football game after it has begun. Live odds and lines will be available for each drive. You can bet on whether the QB will throw an interception or complete his next pass. You can bet on new totals and spreads too. The type of odds available will depend on how much time is left in the game.<\/p><p>Now that you know how to read and understand football odds, go ahead and start betting!<\/p>"

                        "title": "How to Maximize your NFL Betting: What are Power Rankings?",
                        "content": "<p>Armed with statistics and knowledge of the game, NFL bettors can make educated decisions on which team will win or cover instead of just leaving things up to blind luck. One of the tools at your disposal are Power Rankings.<\/p><p>NFL betting is our forte, and like Matt Forte in his prime, we can ensure your bets pose a dual threat every Sunday, Monday, Thursday and some Saturdays.<\/p><h2>How are NFL Power Rankings Calculated?<\/h2><p>When you look at the odds for any given NFL game you wish to bet on, you may wonder what the chances are of your team covering. This is a valid question, and one that the betting public asks in the 17 weeks leading up to the Super Bowl. With a Power Rankings system in place, you can make smart picks.<\/p><p>Here at Handspit, we have the tools and the talent to understand how to calculate power rankings. Our rankings take into account different factors like points scored, strength of schedule, roster moves, and how a team has done in the past ATS.<\/p><h3>Historical Spread Coverage<\/h3><p>When we rank teams, we want to see how they\u2019ve measured up in the past. To do this, we use our Odds and Handicapping Database. This allows us to see a team\u2019s history of covering against certain opponents, home\/road splits, as the favorite, as the underdog, and the month the games were played in.<\/p><p>Let\u2019s say we want to see how the New Orleans Saints stack up against the Atlanta Falcons in September as a road favorite in their last 30 meetings. Our Odds Database tells us that since 1988, the Saints have covered once, in 1991. This indicates that in their next game against Atlanta,\u00a0there\u2019s a strong chance that they won\u2019t cover.<\/p><h3>Strength of Schedule<\/h3><p>A team\u2019s opponent can help us determine where they should sit in the rankings. A team like the New England Patriots is a dynamo because they not only have good coaching, an elite quarterback\u00a0and a defense that can stop a shark attack, but they also play against lesser teams. Their division consists of the Miami Dolphins, the New York Jets and the Buffalo Bills. The aforementioned teams may not give the Pats much of a fight on the field. They are also going to face their division rivals many times during the regular season, probably leading to huge wins every time.<\/p><p>On the other hand, a team like the Green Bay Packers could find themselves rising in the rankings because of who they\u2019re playing against. They share a division with the Chicago Bears, the Minnesota Vikings and the Detroit Lions, who are all considered tougher teams.<\/p><p>A team that constantly plays against tougher opponents will rise in the rankings if they unfailingly win. A team that frequently faces off against lesser squads will not shift their position in the rankings unless they have the offense and defense to back it up, like the Patriots.<\/p><p>NFL Standings will only tell a part of the story. The Dallas Cowboys could be in first by Week 4 of the regular season because they\u2019ve only played against teams who are still finding their groove, whereas the Pittsburgh Steelers may be in third place but have faced teams that have given them a run for their money.<\/p><h3>Free Agency<\/h3><p>During the offseason, the Indianapolis Colts could find themselves acquiring the best running back in the league. Because of this move, they will climb in the NFL Power Rankings. But, the team that\u00a0lost the best RB in the league will descend unless it was able to acquire other tools to fill that roster void.<\/p><h3>Injuries<\/h3><p>Teams will rise and fall in the rankings if star players succumb to injuries, especially if it\u2019s a quarterback. This is a key position that can make or break a game. The same goes for a strong running back or wide receiver. Injuries to a key D-lineman can also cause a team to drop a few notches in the rankings.<\/p><h2>Using the Numbers<\/h2><p>Each team has two scores: defensive (touchdowns and field goals they give up) and offensive (what they earn). One mistake that some bettors make when trying to predict scores is simply taking the average of a team\u2019s O-scores in past weeks. If the Los Angeles Rams have scored 31, 28, 35, 3 and 27 over the last five weeks, their average score would be 24.8 points per game.<\/p><p>In reality, this projection is putting too much weight on the game in which the team only scored 3, which seems to be an anomaly. The reason they were held to only a field goal in that game could range from the weather to the strength of the other team\u2019s defense to injuries.<\/p><p>Instead, find the median score another way by listing the totals from highest to lowest: 3, 27, 28, 31, 35. This gives us a median, or more accurately, a middle score of 28 which makes a lot more sense. So, should we pencil in the Rams to score 28 this week? That depends on the defense they are facing. NFL teams average about 23 points per game, which LA, on average, beats by five.<\/p><p>If LA faces a Seattle Seahawks team with a median defensive score of 13 (allowing 3, 10, 13, 17 and 30 over their last five games), that is 10 points below the average. To calculate what the Rams are projected to score, you would take the league average of 23 plus\u00a0their offensive extra 5 points minus\u00a0the Seahawks\u2019 D-score loss of 10 (23+5-10) = 18 points.<\/p><p>However, against a Kansas City Chiefs team giving up a median of 28 points per game, the Rams will project to score 23 + 5 + 5 = 33. Because football scores are based on increments of 3 or 7 (field goals and touchdowns), that score of 33 will probably look more like 31 or 35.<\/p><p>You can build your own system to give yourself some reprieve this football season, or use ours. Most of the NFL betting public use professional systems like the one we\u2019ve created at Handspit. Moreover, how we rank teams can be used as a starting point to handicap your football bets. From there, you can make savvy picks by checking the NFL odds and Betting News.<\/p>"

                        "title": "NFL Moneyline vs Spread: A Guide to Football\u2019s Most Popular Bets",
                        "content": "<p>Point spreads and moneylines are two of the most common ways for people to bet on an NFL football game every week. For first-time bettors, and even those who are more seasoned, deciding which bet to make on any given Sunday, Monday, Thursday and some Saturdays in December\u00a0usually comes down to those two betting types.<\/p><p>Here at Handspit, we want you to make smart picks. This page will explore the spread vs moneyline so you can decide which form of betting makes sense for your NFL wagers \u2013 whether it\u2019s the Super Bowl, the NFC wild-card game\u00a0or a typical matchup between the Patriots and Jets.<\/p><h2>What is the Moneyline?<\/h2><p>Moneyline betting is also called straight-up betting. This is the most basic way to bet because you are simply picking a team to win.<\/p><p>When you visit your sportsbook of choice, you\u2019ll see moneyline odds that look something like this:<\/p><p>Falcons -150<\/p><p>Saints +125<\/p><p>In this case Atlanta is the favorite and New Orleans is the underdog. You can always tell which NFL team is the favorite because they are represented by the minus sign (-), whereas underdogs are shown with the plus sign (+). This is universal across all sports and not just the NFL.<\/p><p>If you were to bet $100 on the Falcons and they won, you\u2019d get a payout of $166.67 \u2013 your original $100 comes back along with your winnings of $66.67. On the other hand, the same bet on a triumphant Saints team would give you a payout of $225 \u2013 you get your $100 back and your winnings of $125. When you make your NFL picks, you do not have to wager $100. You can bet any amount you want. Our Odds Calculator can help you determine how much you\u2019d win based on the amount you bet.<\/p><h2>What is the Point Spread?<\/h2><p>Point spreads are a little more advanced, but still pretty easy to wrap your head around. Rather than choosing outright who will win the game, the spread allows you to choose by how much that team will win or lose.<\/p><p>Spread odds would look something like this:<\/p><p>Cowboys -3.5<\/p><p>Texans +3.5<\/p><p>For this NFL betting example, Dallas has to win the game by four or more points and Houston has to win the game outright or not lose by more than three points. A winning bet would be on whichever team covers the spread.<\/p><p>The spread is the key unit of measurement between two sides when it comes to NFL betting. This is what oddsmakers \u2013 those who set the betting lines for NFL and other sports \u2013 use to define how much better one team is perceived to be than their opponent in an effort to create equal action on both sides of the bet.<\/p><p>Spreads usually come with half-points such as 3.5 because this eliminates the option of pushing a game\u00a0because of a tie \u2013 which can happen in the NFL, although it is rare. A PUSH is when the final score or final spread hits the oddsmaker\u2019s number exactly and your bet is refunded.<\/p><h2>Moneyline vs Spread: Finding Betting Value<\/h2><p>Typically, the moneyline odds on a favorite don\u2019t appear to have much significance. Sportsbooks will give points to an underdog and take points away from the favorite. This can be pretty valuable when betting on a heavy favorite if their moneyline is outrageous at something like -200 where you\u2019d have to bet $200 to win $100. That same team could be -8.5 favorites and if they cover that by winning by nine or more points, the odds could be lower at, let\u2019s say, -130. In some cases, you can even find plus (+) money if the spread is very large. In scenarios like that, an NFL spread may be more useful because you are confident in a team winning but there may be more worth for that team to win by 8.5 or more points.<\/p><p>Continuing with the moneyline vs spread debate, a straight-up bet can be very profitable if you have an angle or consensus data on why the underdog is going to win the game. Unless it\u2019s a close game with pick\u2019em odds (where both teams are offered at -110), the dog usually has plus odds. For instance, the Seahawks could be -200 favorites to beat the Chargers, who are coming back at +150. If you feel that Los Angeles is going to win when you make your picks, you could lay down $100 and profit an extra $150.<\/p><p>When you are deciding to bet on the underdog, it\u2019s always important to consider both the NFL moneyline and the point spread. If the point spread is low, such as +2.5, the odds will likely be greater to just bet that team to win outright rather than succumb to their opponent by two or fewer points. If an underdog team has a spread of +2.5, the odds for that may be -160 whereas for them to win outright would likely be plus-money, maybe at +130.<\/p><p>Final scores matter for both sports betting options, and sportsbooks will offer NFL odds on both spreads and moneylines, but it all comes down to where you think the betting value lies. Just remember that when you bet on a point spread, you\u2019re actually betting on the number of points a team needs to cover and not the final score like you would with the moneyline.<\/p><p>Our NFL Database can help you decide which side of a bet to take. This handicapping tool shows you how two teams performed against the spread (ATS) and each other in their previous matchups. Complete with scores and wager info, you\u2019ll be able to make spread and\/or moneyline bets each week like a pro.<\/p>"

This information can give you an edge when placing your football bets on any given team.<\/p><h2>NFL Historical Spreads and Results<\/h2><p>Handspit provides bettors with historical data and odds records in an easy-to-use archive. Not to toot our own horn, our database rules like the 1994 San Francisco 49ers. We offer one of the best sports databases on the internet to give bettors enough handicapping info to make smart picks. You can search for head-to-head matchup data between any two teams, in any month, at any location, and with any point spread \u2013 for any time during the season, preseason, and postseason games.<\/p><p>Let\u2019s say you want to know how the New England Patriots have performed against the New York Jets in October, on their home turf over the last 10 games. You can find all that out in seconds with our database. NFL against the spread history gives you a snapshot of how a squad has contended in different situations and what the odds were.<\/p><p>Database searches can also be done on team vs division or team vs conference, giving you even more betting insight. For example, you can check in with the Green Bay Packers and see how they\u2019ve fared against the AFC East in their last 10, 20 or 30 games, or vs the entire AFC in those same time periods \u2013 at home, on the road or at any location.<\/p><p>Moreover, our database allows you to search for results for any team before or after their bye week.

This is the average of facts and figures from several Vegas casinos and online sportsbooks. We use this system because it is a fair representation of the info bettors would have received before game time. The only factors our database does not track are line moves and live odds. If the Dallas Cowboys were listed at -7 on a Tuesday in December 2011 and the line closed at -5.5, the database will show -5.5. Plus, if there were live odds offered during this specific game, our archive won\u2019t pick it up.<\/p><p>Starting in 1980, every NFL point spread, OVER\/UNDER result\u00a0and score is stored here in our databank. From 1990 onward, every box score and stat joined the archive to forge this mammoth database. Our historical odds system was established to give you a huge archive that you can easily sort through. This allows everyone to search their own angles and find their own trends instead of relying on websites that only display old matchup reports and rankings without context. You need context, otherwise you\u2019re looking at a bunch of nonsense.

For bettors, it could prove to be a money-making endeavor and an optimal online betting experience. You don\u2019t have to wait until September and the regular season to start betting. The NFL preseason can offer a chance to make smart picks if you follow our tutorial.<\/p><p>Starting off with the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game at the beginning of August, there are four weeks of games that are ripe for the betting. Below we\u2019ll give you tips and strategies for betting on football that are different from what you\u2019d use for the Super Bowl or the regular season.<\/p><h2>Betting on NFL Preseason Games<\/h2><p>As soon as training camps end, the preseason begins. Last year\u2019s Super Bowl winner may have the odds in their favor, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can bet on them blindly. Sure, the New England Patriots will always be an attractive moneyline option, but before you lay down money on Belichick and Brady, do a little handicapping homework. Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re here to help.<\/p><p>Here are our top strategies and tips for preseason NFL betting:<\/p><h3>Don\u2019t Look to the Future<\/h3><p>Starters often get to rest for some portions of the game. Most head coaches will sit their stars in order to protect them from injury. For instance, you may not see Drew Brees at all during the fourth quarter of a preseason game because Sean Payton wants to keep his No. 1\u00a0player healthy. If you were going to bet on a Saints vs Eagles game, it\u2019s assumed that stars would spend at least one quarter of the game on the bench. You might think that looking at newbies could give you an edge. Now, if a player is straight out of college, their NCAA football stats aren\u2019t going to tell you much about how they\u2019ll play in the NFL.<\/p><p>The only thing you have to go on is training camp and even that won\u2019t paint the whole picture. Instead, focus on the team as a whole. There will be media reports if a team isn\u2019t getting along. There may be camp holdouts and injured players who won\u2019t factor in August\u2019s NFL games. Paying close attention to breaking news stories regarding the team you want to bet on will help you stay on top of your bets.<\/p><p>While you will never find NFL head coaches \u2013 more on them in a moment \u2013 sitting down with the media during the regular season to share their total plans, the same doesn\u2019t apply for the preseason. Instead, coaches will often provide key info worth betting on, like exactly how long the starters will play, and how much field time the backup quarterback and new offensive linemen are going to see.<\/p><p>Our NFL Betting News page can give you all the information you need to keep up with your bets.<\/p><h3>Head Coaches are Key<\/h3><p>Not all coaches are created equal when it comes to their approach to preseason games. Some want to win, especially new coaches who want to establish a winning culture right away or those who feel they have scores to settle with their division opponents. Others do not care, and instead\u00a0treat the exhibition game the same way they would treat training camp or practice \u2013 get their players on the field and let them learn or make mistakes until they get it right.<\/p><p>Preseason coaching records become valuable handicapping tools to help you identify betting trends associated with each team from year to year. There are different motivations that each coach uses when planning for a game, depending on their team, coaching staff, and if they are new to their job or incumbents.<\/p><p>Pay close attention to the men at the helm of each team and you will likely find NFL betting edges. An old pro like John Harbaugh (Baltimore Ravens) is known to cover the spread, with a record of 20-10 ATS in the preseason since 2011. Conversely, another old pro, Mike Tomlin (Pittsburgh Steelers), has an ATS record of 13-17 for the same time frame. Both head coaches are Super Bowl winners yet have vastly different game plans when it comes to attacking NFL preseason games.<\/p><h3>Watch for Line Moves<\/h3><p>Remember how we said that you shouldn\u2019t look to the future because who knows how a newbie will play, especially if he\u2019s fresh out of college? This still applies. However, what you can watch for are line moves.<\/p><p>Football odds during the NFL preseason are generally limited to around a field goal for one side or the other unless there is extra information available affecting the game that could impact betting lines. Let\u2019s pretend that the New England Patriots are facing off against the Green Bay Packers and the line opened like this:<\/p><p>Patriots -3.5<\/p><p>Packers +3.5<\/p><p>On Thursday, Pats QB Tom Brady is confirmed to play the first three quarters of the game, but Aaron Rodgers is sitting this match out. Oddsmakers will take this into consideration and move the betting odds to something like this:<\/p><p>Pats -7.5<\/p><p>Packers +7.5<\/p><p>Oddsmakers move the line from a field goal to a touchdown because it\u2019s assumed that without Rodgers, New England\u2019s defense will have a great advantage over Green Bay\u2019s offense.<\/p><p>When information becomes available to the public, sportsbooks will rapidly change the odds to reflect said info. As a bettor, watching for line moves will give you an advantage during the preseason so you can pounce on better odds.<\/p><h3>Watch Your Wallet<\/h3><p>Money management is key when gambling on sports, and like regular-season wagers, preseason betting also requires capital. Nothing in this life is free \u2013 except for our Picks page \u2013 and you need to ensure that you\u2019re not draining your online betting account by recklessly backing the Dallas Cowboys by ignoring the consensus or the NFL preseason odds.<\/p><p>Some bettors separate their money into weekly sections in order to guarantee they\u2019re not betting beyond their means. Bet smartly, and responsibly, otherwise you could find yourself lacking the funds to bet during the regular season. This applies to all sports, not just football.<\/p><h2>Are Futures Bets the Same as Preseason Bets?<\/h2><p>There is often confusion surrounding futures bets and the preseason. A futures wager is a bet that you can make at any point before the NFL season starts until the playoffs. These are long-term bets like which team will win the Super Bowl, which team will win their division, or who will be named MVP. This type of betting has nothing to do with the preseason, but is often confused with betting on exhibition games. Make sure when you\u2019re at your sportsbook of choice that you don\u2019t accidentally select futures odds on Matt Ryan or Russell Wilson leading their teams to the big game instead of betting on a Falcons vs Seahawks match in August \u2013 unless, of course, that\u2019s your intention.<\/p><h2>How to Sign up at a Sportsbook<\/h2><p>If you don\u2019t already have an online betting account, it\u2019s time to get one so you can start wagering on football. We have vetted all the sportsbooks we recommend to ensure that they are trustworthy and safe. Look for bonuses and promotional offers that are specific to the preseason when you make your first deposit. Some online betting sites will give bettors discounts or match their first deposit if they use Bitcoin or PayPal.<\/p><h2>The Value of Betting on the NFL Preseason<\/h2><p>Unlike other sports like spring training for MLB or the G League in the NBA, NFL preseason betting does have value to bettors. Online betting sites will offer lines and odds on everything from the Hall of Fame Game to what may seem like a meaningless match between the Saints and Colts. The preseason schedule attracts huge interest from casual betting fans and sharps alike because there is money to be made for football bettors who pay attention to free agency, training camps and holdouts.<\/p><p>Even though the NFL preseason lasts only four weeks, that is still an extra month of games to wager on regardless of who is on the field and for how long. As we touched on above, both of those factors should be considered when handicapping an exhibition game. However, the most important thing is to have fun. The whole point of betting on football is to enjoy yourself. Yes, there is money involved but if you\u2019re not having a good time watching a preseason game, what\u2019s the point of betting on the NFL at all? If you use our strategies, we cannot guarantee that you\u2019ll win tons of cash, but we can promise that you\u2019ll have a blast trying.<\/p>"

                        "content": "<p>When it comes to sports betting, the NFL offers season-long opportunities to try out different betting strategies. Even fans who know little about wagering on football can (hopefully) make money by following Handspit\u2019s NFL tutorials.<\/p><p>For those who are looking for a new tactic to approach football betting, why not try looking at the consensus and making picks against the public?<\/p><h2>What is the NFL Consensus?<\/h2><p>In betting, the consensus translates to what percentage the general public is taking on each side of a game. Some NFL bettors will always bet with the public no matter which teams are playing and what the betting trends say. For others, the public is always wrong and they will constantly bet against them when making their football picks.<\/p><p>Let\u2019s say the New England Patriots are playing the Miami Dolphins. NFL odds for that game would look something like this:<\/p>TeamSpreadATS ConsensusOVER\/UNDERO\/U ConsensusPatriots-2.556%34 OVER58%Dolphins+2.544%34 UNDER42%<p>In this case, 56 percent\u00a0of the betting public believe\u00a0the Pats will cover the spread and 58 percent\u00a0of bettors believe that the total will go OVER 34 points.<\/p><p>If you believe that the 56 percent\u00a0are right, you are betting with the public. Conversely, if you believe that the 44 percent\u00a0are right, you are betting against the public. This is also known as \u201cfading\u201d because you are taking the other side of where the NFL public money is going.<\/p><h2>Watch for Line Movements<\/h2><p>Successful point spread betting involves trying to get the best odds. First-time bettors may put their money down on a particular team because they like them, which in turn\u00a0forces the sportsbook to adjust their opening odds.<\/p><p>Sharps \u2013 experienced bettors \u2013 see these initial line moves and try to wait as long as possible until they believe the odds are at their peak before betting the other side. In the case of going against public money NFL bets, all you really need is the line to move to make a solid bet.<\/p><p>For example, the Kansas City Chiefs are playing the Los Angeles Rams and the odds opened like this on Monday:<\/p><p>Chiefs -7.5<\/p><p>Rams +7.5<\/p><p>Let\u2019s pretend the public is heavily backing the Chiefs. But, by Thursday the line moves to -3.5\/+3.5 because of an injury to a key player, shifting the odds. KC is no longer favored by a touchdown, allowing you to pounce on these new odds and take the other side.<\/p><p>Following NFL line moves gives you the chance to figure out who the public is betting on and determine which side of the bet you want to back. You can also look to our Betting Trends page for even more handicapping data, like how often the total has gone OVER or UNDER when these two squads played each other in the past.<\/p><h2>Can You Outsmart a Sportsbook by Fading the Public?<\/h2><p>A successful oddsmaker is one who anticipates the public by looking at betting trends, past scores and odds. If NFL bettors knew what they were doing on a consistent basis, online betting sites would not make any money. So, to answer that question: No, you cannot outsmart a sportsbook. Why? Because odds experts are the ones who set the opening numbers with the public in mind, trying to get them to lean in a certain direction. Since the betting community tends to be wrong as much as they are right, sportsbooks use these trends to their advantage when setting the odds and betting lines. However, that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t make a profit betting against the NFL public and waiting for better odds.<\/p><p>Two of the most common public plays are taking the favorite and OVER odds in nationally televised games such as Monday Night Football. They also tend to like popular teams like the Dallas Cowboys, Pittsburgh Steelers, New Orleans Saints and whoever won the previous season\u2019s Super Bowl. Lines on those teams are created accordingly so bettors willing to take the underdog are typically working with an extra point, if not more than that. That can be a significant edge and will pay off over the course of a season, resulting in a few extra wins.<\/p><p>If you\u2019re unsure if fading the public is the right move for you, choose the moneyline. You can still bet against the consensus, but instead of trying to figure out if one team is more likely to cover over the other, or if the total is going to go OVER or UNDER the oddsmaker\u2019s set number, you simply have to pick a winner.<\/p>"

                        "content": "<p>While some NFL bettors make their bets prior to the game\u2019s start, online sportsbooks now offer the option to jump in on the action while the game is being played with live odds. Live NFL betting is when you place a wager on a game after it has already started.<\/p><h2>How to Live Bet an NFL Game<\/h2><p>Most sportsbooks offer an In-Play option that would show the bettor how much time is remaining in the game, the line history\u00a0and what the current score is. If you select that game, you\u2019ll be privy to lines and odds that you can wager on.<\/p><p>Moreover, odds change as the game goes on. A team that opens as a 7-point favorite might fall to -4\u00a0or -3\u00a0after falling into a 7-0 deficit early. If you have a good eye for teams that seem primed for a comeback, or sense an upset could be in the making, you can take advantage of your instincts with live wagering and pad your bankroll.<\/p><p>In order to bet live on an NFL game, you simply select the In-Play or Live button and you\u2019re good to go. Live odds will be available, ready for you to start betting.<\/p><h2>In-Play Betting Options<\/h2><p>The type of bets available would depend on how much time has elapsed in the football game and the sports betting site you wager with.<\/p><h3>Moneyline<\/h3><p>Live moneyline bets are like the same straight-up bets you\u2019d make before the game starts. Here, you\u2019ll simply need to pick a winner. You can look at betting trends from the past or you can make an educated guess based on the live odds.<\/p><h3>Point Spread<\/h3><p>Like a traditional point spread bet, odds for the live version would look something like this:<\/p><p>Los Angeles Rams -4.5<\/p><p>Oakland Raiders +4.5<\/p><p>If you believe the Rams will cover the spread, they would need to win by five points or more. Conversely, for the Raiders to cover the spread, they would need to win outright or not lose by more than four points.<\/p><h3>Prop Bet<\/h3><p>Prop betting is where live NFL betting gets even more entertaining. For example, at the beginning of each drive, live bettors can bet on drive results such as how long the upcoming drive will be or whether it will end with a field goal, touchdown or turnover. As the drive is progressing, bettors are also offered the option to bet on what the next play will be (a run, a completed pass, an incomplete pass\u00a0or an interception).<\/p><h3>Totals<\/h3><p>As with any totals bet you would forecast if the total score set by oddsmakers would be less or more than predicted. If the totals betting odds for a game between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Dallas Cowboys is set at 38.5 before the game, the live total will probably change. For instance, at the beginning of the fourth quarter the new live total odds could switch to 63.5 if both teams are putting on a scoring clinic. For this live bet, you would need to decide if you think the total would go OVER 64 or UNDER 63.<\/p><h2>In-Play Football Betting Tips<\/h2><p>When it comes to live betting sports, you should not only watch the game carefully but use our tips. Handspit\u2019s here to help you make smart picks whether it\u2019s a live prop bet on the Dolphins\u2019 kicker or an in-game spread bet on the Colts and Chiefs.<\/p><h3>Predetermine Your Strategy<\/h3><p>Coming up with a strategy before the game starts may sound counterproductive to betting live, but you\u2019ll need a loose plan based on the two teams playing. Use your knowledge of football to determine the types of live bets you want to make. Knowing how specific coaches and teams handle exact situations will dictate if you\u2019ll correctly predict which team will cover the spread or what an offensive coordinator is likely to draw up on his next play.<\/p><p>Knowing that a certain head coach who likes to wear visors \u2013 looking at you, Sean Payton \u2013 likes to go for it on fourth down, combined with his aggressive play-calling and Drew Brees\u2019 effectiveness at quarterback, could provide great live betting value on the New Orleans Saints. Make sure you know how each team will react to each play, whether it\u2019s an aggressive defensive strategy that will keep their opponent to nothing more than a field goal, or an offensive showcase with a passing game that runs through defenses like a sprinkler on a hot day.<\/p><p>Some teams take their time getting down the field and rack up as many yards as they can before finally scoring. On the other hand, some teams fumble \u2013 pun intended \u2013 their way to a win. Keep that in mind when betting live.<\/p><h3>Key Numbers<\/h3><p>NFL games are generally decided by three\u00a0or seven\u00a0points. These are called key numbers because a field goal is three\u00a0points, and a touchdown is six\u00a0points with the PAT counting for one\u00a0point (totaling seven). With live bets, the odds are constantly shifting, so it\u2019s important to keep these numbers in mind. This isn\u2019t the CFL where scores can total two\u00a0points, or any other sport for that matter, where goals or runs count for only one\u00a0point. This is the NFL. Be wary of live odds lines that deviate from the key numbers themselves (or multiples of them like 14, 28, etc.).<\/p><h3>Oddsmakers Know about Injuries<\/h3><p>If a star gets hurt and is removed from the game, oddsmakers take that into consideration when setting live odds. The moment a key player like Aaron Rodgers or Khalil Mack goes down, the live betting odds will reflect that. It may take a few moments for these odds adjustments to occur, but it will happen.<\/p><h3>Bankroll Management<\/h3><p>An important part of football betting \u2013 or betting on any sport \u2013 is being able to manage your money. One of the major facets of being a successful live bettor is bankroll management. Set aside an amount for each game that makes sense for your wallet. Next, break that amount down into smaller betting units. Good money management will help you avoid disaster when some bizarre trick play or a Hail Mary goes against you on Sunday.<\/p><h2>Forecasting Momentum Swings<\/h2><p>In the end, betting NFL games live is all about predicting changes to momentum. If you can successfully guess how a team will respond to their surroundings, be it a pass rush, a trick play or any other possibility that can take place during a football game, you\u2019ll become a live betting pro in no time.<\/p><h5>Wagering Info and Odds<\/h5><p>\u2022 Betting News<\/p><p>\u2022 Odds <\/p><p>\u2022 Free Picks <\/p><p>\u2022 Consensus<\/p><p>\u2022 Betting Trends<\/p>"

                        "content": "<p>Betting on the NFL can be profitable if you know what you\u2019re doing. You may be familiar with point spread betting, a popular way to bet on football, but handicapping totals is also an exciting way to wager on the NFL.<\/p><p>Here at Handspit, we\u2019ve compiled an OVER\/UNDER betting strategy. If there\u2019s one thing we do better than anyone else, it\u2019s sports betting. We\u2019re also pros at yelling at the TV whenever a kicker misses an easy extra point, but that\u2019s neither here nor there nor in between the uprights.<\/p><h2>How to Bet OVER\/UNDER on NFL Games<\/h2><p>Totals are created by sportsbooks to create equal action on both sides of a bet. To make this type of bet, you\u2019re looking for the total number of points scored by both teams in the matchup. If two teams combined to score more total points than the oddsmaker\u2019s set number, the OVER is a winner. Likewise, if the teams score fewer combined points than the total, the UNDER wins.<\/p><p>Let\u2019s break it down \u2013 odds generally look something like this:<\/p><p>New England Patriots vs Los Angeles Chargers = 37.5<\/p><h3>What Happens When the Number Hits Exactly?<\/h3><p>Some odds will not have a decimal. In the example above, we used 37.5 as the total. However, odds may be an even number. The same two teams could meet again during the season and the total could be 38 instead of 37.5.<\/p><p>If you think that both teams combined are going to score more than 38 points, you would take the OVER. On the other hand, if you don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a high-scoring affair, and believe the points scored by both squads is going to be 37 or less, you would take the UNDER. But, if the joint score is 38 exactly, that is called a PUSH. In this case, you would get your money back since neither the OVER nor the UNDER hit.<\/p><h2>How do Oddsmakers Set the Totals?<\/h2><p>When bookmakers set odds and betting lines, they look at a variety of factors. Sports betting sites hire odds experts to calculate how much the combined score between two teams will be. These odds specialists look at previous meetings between the two teams, how each team handles down conversions, their field-goal percentages, rushing yards, and completions and interceptions.<\/p><h2>Handicapping Tips: OVER\/UNDER Strategy<\/h2><p>As a sports bettor, you need to do some homework. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not as intense as anything you had to do in high school \u2013 you\u2019re simply handicapping your totals bet enough to make smart picks.<\/p><h3>Watch the Odds<\/h3><p>Some bettors love to wager on the OVER because they enjoy seeing a lot of scoring action. Oddsmakers take betting behavior like that into consideration when setting the odds. Oftentimes action can come in on the OVER throughout the week leading up to a typical NFL game, which causes the total to climb. In turn, oddsmakers must adjust the line accordingly to keep up with the football betting public.<\/p><p>Keep an eye on the odds and any line movements throughout the days leading up to the game. If you like the OVER, make sure to take it early in the week before the number rises. If you\u2019re leaning toward\u00a0the UNDER, consider holding off on your bet until closer to kickoff when\u00a0the total should be at its highest.<\/p><h3>Betting Trends and Stats<\/h3><p>Much like how spread betting is affected if a key player is out with an injury, factors like that can change the totals too. Always make sure to evaluate weather conditions, offensive and defensive stats, and home\/away and indoor\/outdoor splits before making a call on the totals. For instance, a warm-weather quarterback who usually plays in a dome environment may have a hard time lobbing TDs during a snowy outdoor game.<\/p><p>In addition, routinely take a look at betting trends and the reasons behind why a particular team is cashing the OVER or UNDER with regularity. These trends can tell us which sides bettors generally take. For example, how does the NFL betting public lean when the Jets are playing the Pats at home, or what happens to the total score when the Vikings meet the Packers on the road.<\/p><p>You can also look at the following Handspit pages to handicap your totals picks:<\/p><p>\u2022 Consensus \u2013 How is the NFL sports betting public taking each side of a totals bet?<\/p><p>\u2022 Standings \u2013 Go beyond traditional standings and see how your squad does when it comes to game total bets.<\/p><p>\u2022 Team Reports \u2013 A synopsis of all NFL squads.<\/p><p>\u2022 Game Logs \u2013 How any given team fared for any given game.<\/p><p>\u2022 Power Rankings \u2013 Sports are all about how each team stacks up against another.<\/p><h3>OVER\/UNDER Betting NFL Total Scores<\/h3><p>Remember that in the NFL, scores are determined in three- or seven-point intervals. A field goal is three points and a touchdown is six, along with the potential point after touchdown making it seven. There are times where a team will try to attempt a two-point conversion, but don\u2019t bank on this every game. Most coaches will only go for two if they absolutely need to even the score in a do-or-die situation like a playoff game.<\/p><h2>Betting on Football<\/h2><p>Remember that betting on football, or any sport\u00a0for that matter, should be fun, like watching a bear try to understand the mechanics of a trampoline. If you\u2019re not having a good time betting on the combined score between two teams, whether it\u2019s a regular Sunday afternoon game or the Super Bowl, take a step back, call an audible and figure out why.<\/p><p>Are you betting too much of your bankroll and wasting your Bitcoin on bets you\u2019re not hitting? Are you betting too little and not seeing enough of a return? Are you forgetting that the oddsmaker\u2019s set number is a combination of both teams\u2019 scores? Once you determine why you\u2019re faltering, rethink your betting strategy (or adjust your handicapping to include the tips we mentioned above) and you\u2019ll have more fun than a bear on a trampoline during NFL season.<\/p>"

In a perfect world, every game would have every player playing at 100 percent, but that just isn\u2019t realistic.<\/p><p>Some games will see a team feeling fresh, confident, energetic\u00a0and ready to play at a high level. In other games, the emotional and physical toll of a long season will show on the field or court, making a team look sluggish and unfocused.<\/p><p>Every week we see teams inexplicably play way above or below their potential, much to our joy when we are on the right side of those instances and much to our dismay when we are on the wrong side. In many cases, it is hard to predict when a team is going to play one of these out-of-character games, but one angle to consider is the Sandwich Game Theory.<\/p><h2>What is a Sandwich Game?<\/h2><p>A \u201csandwich game\u201d is a seemingly inconspicuous game sandwiched between two very important or very difficult games. For example, this season, the Kansas City Chiefs are expected to make some strides in the AFC West but they have a potential sandwich or \"trap\" game very early in their schedule. The Chiefs start on the road against two Super Bowl contenders: the Chargers and the Steelers. They then return home for a game vs San Francisco before heading to Denver to play the rival Broncos.\u00a0<\/p><p>While not much is expected out of the 49ers this season, they could be very dangerous to Kansas City in Week 3. After two hard-hitting, high-level games vs LA and Pittsburgh on the road to start the season, Kansas City returns home to their families, children, bills and real life for just one week before heading out on the road again.\u00a0<\/p><p>Think about it from your perspective. If you were travelling for two weeks and came home for just a few days, think about\u00a0all the things you have to deal with. On top of that, the hype that comes with a team's home opener can also lead to an emotional letdown on the field. This is the exact\u00a0definition and fear when it comes to a sandwich game and it may affect the Chiefs\u00a0on the point spread.<\/p><p>When you see a situation such as this one, when a team has a non-division opponent in between two big games, give them a strong look. You will likely catch the team in its sandwich game playing something less than its best.<\/p>"

However, you don\u2019t need a calculator or a sophisticated algorithm to make smart college football bets. All you need is a basic understanding of how odds work to know if you should bet against a ranked team.<\/p><h2>Betting Against Teams that are Ranked<\/h2><p>Some college football bettors would tell you that wagering on ranked road underdogs against an unranked home foe is an out-and-out trap, but the numbers suggest otherwise. Sure, no system is foolproof, however, the reality is that the rankings tend to point bettors in the right direction.\u00a0<\/p><p>It\u2019s a tricky thing, of course, but the majority of ranked dogs cover the spread against unranked opponents. It\u2019s a tough call when a No. 25 team is the underdog on the road against an unranked home team. When it doubt, you can always take the underdog because they\u2019re ranked and that seems safe.<\/p><p>You can also look at the scenario from the other side. The team is ranked 25th because they\u2019ve barely squeaked into the rankings. The team that isn\u2019t ranked is playing at home and the odds are telling you they\u2019re going to win or cover the spread.<\/p><h2>Key to Betting Ranked Underdogs<\/h2><p>Remember that betting math we were talking about? Here\u2019s where you will need it. Don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t actually have to do any adding, subtracting or fractioning. Look at the odds and see what they say.<\/p><p>If Florida is ranked 25th and they are playing Colorado State who have no ranking, you need to look at the numbers to give you a better idea of which team to bet on. In this hypothetical situation let\u2019s say that the Gators are the underdog. The Rams are the favorite, and they\u2019re playing at home.<\/p><p>Florida is 2-5 against the spread (ATS). Colorado State is 6-2 (ATS). The predicted score is 32.7 for the Rams and 12.7 for the Gators. In this case, you would want to take Colorado State even though Florida is ranked.<\/p><p>The key to all of this is to do your usual college football handicapping, letting the opportunity act as a chance to evaluate the situation in an in-depth manner. Don\u2019t blindly take every ranked underdog \u2013 you and your bankroll will be sorry.<\/p><p>You should also look at the following:<\/p><ul class=\"list\"><li class=\"list__item\">Is the unranked team close to being ranked?<\/li><li class=\"list__item\">Injuries<\/li><li class=\"list__item\">Weather conditions<\/li><li class=\"list__item\">Who should win the game outright?<\/li><li class=\"list__item\">Does the home team carry a strong home-field advantage?<\/li><li class=\"list__item\">What is the consensus \u2013 basically, who is everyone else betting on?<\/li><li class=\"list__item\">How have the teams played recently?<\/li><\/ul><h2>What about Ranked Underdogs at Home?<\/h2><p>Taking this angle further, it\u2019s usually pure gold when the situation is reversed. But, before you jump all over ranked college football underdogs who are playing at home against an unranked team, look at the math again.<\/p><p>A sharper wager could be to take ranked home underdogs against a road favorite. Chances are, you\u2019ll have more points to work with, and conference rivalries could come into play.<\/p><p>For this example, let\u2019s use Nevada and Vanderbilt. If Vandy is ranked 4th and Nevada isn\u2019t ranked at all, you would look at the odds to see who is the favorite. In this fake game, we\u2019ll say that the Wolf Pack is the favorite, but the Commodores are playing at home.<\/p><p>Vanderbilt is 3-2 ATS whereas Nevada is 1-5 ATS. The predicted score is 20.4-19.4 in favor of the Wolf Pack but they may not cover the spread. With a predicted score that close, it\u2019s possible that Vanderbilt will pull out a win. Even though they\u2019re the underdog, they\u2019re playing at home and are high up in the rankings. They\u2019re also more likely to cover the spread.<\/p><p>After looking at injuries, the consensus and weather conditions, you determine that in this case you would take the ranked underdog over the unranked favorite.<\/p><p>See, you didn\u2019t need to pay attention in math class to understand college football odds.<\/p>"

Always check the injury report, the consensus and the odds.<\/p><p>If the home team in a rivalry game is having a down year while the other team is playing well, bettors can sometimes find the home team going off as the betting underdog on the point spread.<\/p><p>Even the slightest miscues from the road favorite will get the crowd going nuts, and even the most talented of teams can get rattled in a dangerous spot like this.<\/p><p>On the flip side, big home favorites can also provide value in rivalry games. Bettors who hear about the rivalry all week long could get hyped up into taking the points, but if one team is having a stronger season and has its fan base behind it, the rout could be on.<\/p><h2>Should you bet on the Team with Nothing to Lose?<\/h2><p>Most rivalry games have equal stakes, as both teams want desperately to defeat their hated rivals. Sometimes, one team needs the game much more than other. In those cases, you can find great value on betting on the hungry underdog.<\/p><p>magine a one-loss Ohio State team is one win away from advancing to the Big Ten Championship. A win will guarantee a return to the College Football Playoff. The only thing standing in the Buckeyes\u2019 way is a trip to the Big House in Michigan.<\/p><p>The Buckeyes may have the better team, but they\u2019ll also have the pressure of over 100,000 screaming Wolverines in the house \u2013 not actual wolverines, that would be dangerous \u2013 all rooting for The Ohio State to fail. Even at home, the team with more to lose isn\u2019t safe. The motivation that comes with playing spoiler against a hated rival is one of the strongest motivators in all of college football.<\/p><p>You should also take note of injuries and weather conditions. If Michigan\u2019s quarterback is out for the big rivalry game, you have to ask yourself whether their 2nd stringer is up to the task. The weather can go either way in this case since Ann Arbor and Columbus are both known for moderate falls and desperate winters.<\/p><p>Look at our College Football Odds page before the game. This way, you can determine which side of the rivalry looks more promising to bet on.<\/p>"

In addition to wanting to represent their school well, these players will appreciate the fact that they are in a bowl game and work hard in the weeks leading up to it.<\/p><p>The same is also true of teams that have a lot of seniors. Top seniors at the big schools may be on their way to the NFL, but the majority of seniors will be playing their last football game ever in these bowl games. A team loaded with seniors at key positions is likely to play very motivated, from the seniors themselves to the teammates who want to send them off with a win.<\/p><p>Losing in a bowl game the previous year can be another strong motivator for bowl teams. After letting their fans and supporters down the year before, a team that gets another shot at a bowl game the following year should have a chip on its shoulder to earn the win this time around.<\/p><h2>Looking for Letdown Spots<\/h2><p>One of the most obvious letdown spots in college football is when an elite team had its sights set on a huge bowl game, only to fall short and end up in a smaller one.<\/p><p>The Alabama Crimson Tide saw their national championship dreams come crashing down in 2014 in a shocking loss in the Iron Bowl after going 11-0 SU and 7-4 ATS in their previous 11 games. Uninterested in the Sugar Bowl that they landed in, the Crimson Tide lost 45-31 to Oklahoma as a 17-point favorite on the point spread.<\/p><p>Another letdown spot is one in which a team\u2019s head coach has taken another coaching job and has left the team before the bowl game. Many college teams are built like families, and having the coach abandon the team for another one can make it hard for some teams to get up for the bowl game to come.<\/p><p>In some bowl games, you can find both a team that is highly motivated and a team that could be poised for a letdown. In these types of matchups, bettors can usually throw the statistics out the window.<\/p>"

We\u2019ll take that challenge and debunk the most important myths. Here at Handspit, we eat challenges for breakfast along with high-protein smoothies because there\u2019s nothing we hate more than silly systems that you might read on a blog written by a guy who works at Wawa and thinks Penn State is going to cover the spread every time.<\/p><p>Some betting angles are worth exploring but the five myths we explore below are pure college football lore.<\/p><h2>Myth: I can be an Expert on All Conferences<\/h2><p>Just because you have the college football package and have access to every game, doesn\u2019t make you an expert on the USC Trojans \u2013 unless you\u2019re Matt Leinart then you better be an expert on the Trojans. At the same time, a New Yorker could know everything about Southern Cal. The point is, it\u2019s still best to bet on just a few select conferences when wagering on college football.<\/p><p>There are simply too many teams out there for one bettor to know it all, regardless of how much you think you know or can know. Instead of focusing on the entire NCAA football organization, pick a conference you like best and learn everything there is to know about those teams. Our Standings page can help you with that.<\/p><h2>Myth: College Football is just like the NFL<\/h2><p>\u201cBetting on the NFL is the same as betting college football!\u201d If we had a dollar for every time we heard novice bettors say that one, we\u2019d be really rich, like \u201ctop of the Forbes list\u201d rich. \u201cFootball is football,\u201d they say. \u201cHogwash!\u201d is what we say. What works when it comes to betting on the NFL doesn\u2019t always translate to college football.<\/p><p>The disparities in talent level and style of play are much more apparent in the college game, making matchups and tendencies all the more important when getting a handle on NCAA football games. Keep in mind that if it works on Sunday, it may not work on Saturday.<\/p><h2>Myth: Mo\u2019 Games = Mo\u2019 Money<\/h2><p>Money makes the world go \u2018round \u2013 just ask the Wu Tang Clan. However, you can\u2019t look at the typical Saturday college football schedule and assume you\u2019re going to get paid by betting on all the games.<\/p><p>Even if you did place a wager on every college football game played on any given Saturday, there\u2019s no guarantee that you would win each bet. There are more betting opportunities for college football based on the sheer amount of games played each week, but you still need to be smart about your wagers, otherwise you will annihilate your bankroll like Arkansas State did to Central Arkansas in 1917. The Red Wolves destroyed the Bears by 110 points. The Bears were held scoreless, which is crazy because in real life a bear would beat a red wolf in a fight.<\/p><h2>Myth: Only Bet on Ranked Teams<\/h2><p>For some reason, this myth continues to be perpetuated even though there\u2019s no clear science on why you should only bet on games that feature top 25 teams. If you do your research on any particular matchup, no matter which teams are playing, you can still make an educated wager. See our page on Betting Against Unranked Teams for more info.<\/p><h2>Myth: Totals Betting is the Only Way to Make a Profit<\/h2><p>Totals betting, aka OVER\/UNDER, is a fine way to bet on college football \u2013 but it\u2019s not the only way to bet on college football. In totals betting you\u2019re wagering on the combined number of points scored by both teams to be OVER or UNDER a certain number. Since college football is often a high-scoring affair, it would seem to some that totals betting is easier than other bets you can make.<\/p><p>Instead of making all your college football wagers as totals bets all the time, you can try the spread betting or moneyline.\u00a0<\/p><p>Momentum in the college game is a much bigger factor than in the NFL. Winning your wagers requires going against the myths to avoid the pitfalls that can damage your bankroll week to week. One of the best developments over the last decades has been the advent of the online sportsbook. Check out any of our top picks and find a place to make your college football wagers.

                        "content": "<p>OVER\/UNDER or totals bets are wagers made on the combined number of points scored by both teams. In a pretend matchup between Missouri and Purdue, the total might be set at 60.5. If you were to bet the OVER, you would need both the Tigers and the Boilermakers to score a combined number of points at 61 or higher. If you were to bet the UNDER, both teams would need to score a combined number of points of 60 or lower.<\/p><h2>Be Wary of Explosive Offensives when Betting the UNDER<\/h2><p>Explosive, fast offenses are an UNDER bettor\u2019s worst nightmare \u2013 unless you are afraid of sharks then fast offenses would be your second worst nightmare. Uptempo offensives that run plays fast and score faster are more likely to see their score sail way OVER the posted total. In cases where teams are known for their explosive offense, the totals can\u2019t seem to be set high enough and you should avoid taking the UNDER if you think the number isn\u2019t high enough.<\/p><p>Fast offenses make for good OVER bets for numerous reasons. Not only does their tempo give them more chances to score, but it also gives opposing defenses less time to reset, which can lead to more points against.<\/p><p>Even when starters are pulled later in the game during a blowout, the backups can continue to run up the score as their coaches will want them to get experience running the offense at the same speed \u2013 not to be confused with Speed, the 5th highest grossing film of 1994.<\/p><p>Look for NCAA football teams that are installing these uptempo offenses and putting up big numbers early in the season. Bettors who can find these sorts of teams before the betting public catches on can usually get a lot of value on the OVER bets.<\/p><h2>Don\u2019t Bet Blindly on OVERS<\/h2><p>So, you know how we just said to look for uptempo teams to bet the OVER? Well, don\u2019t do it blindly. You\u2019ll need to do some research on both teams playing in the matchup you\u2019ve chosen to bet on. Yes, the rapidly evolving fast-paced offensive game in college football is leading to higher-scoring games. But, it is also leading to higher totals set across the board.<\/p><p>While some teams are worth betting on the OVER, there is often value to be found going the other way on the UNDER instead.<\/p><p>For example, a team that runs a standard pro-style offense that is putting up a ton of points against weak out-of-conference foes might get a load of hype and see huge totals set when conference play begins.<\/p><p>However, against teams that aren\u2019t totally mismatched on defense and getting beat on every play, these offenses won\u2019t be nearly as productive, and the UNDER bettors will come out on top.<\/p><p>Focus not only on how many points a team scores, but also how it scores those points.<\/p><p>Most offensive schemes do very well against some defenses and poorly against others, and college football bettors willing to take the time to research these offensive\u00a0vs defensive\u00a0matchups can crush OVER\/UNDER betting at their sportsbook of choice.<\/p>"

                        "content": "<p>Parlay betting in sports involves linking two or more individual bets together into one wager. Remember on The Wire when Omar met with Stringer Bell and Prop Joe for a parlay? This is something totally different.<\/p><p>College football bettors and sportsbooks are both fond of parlays. For bettors, parlays offer the chance at huge payouts on small wagers. Meanwhile, the sportsbooks know that these wagers aren\u2019t always going to hit leading them to make some money too.<\/p><p>Don\u2019t let that discourage you. With the right strategy \u2013 which we will provide below \u2013 you can take advantage of parlay betting in college football and turn a nice profit.<\/p><h2>Correlated Parlays are Key<\/h2><p>With so many different teams in college football, every week features matchups between two teams that clash in styles. These matchups provide excellent opportunities to parlay a side and a total that will in all likelihood go hand-in-hand.<\/p><p>Take, for example, the hypothetical difference between the smashmouth \u2013 not the band \u2013 Stanford Cardinal and the hurry-up offense of the Oregon Ducks. In a pretend battle between these two teams, bettors who like Stanford and the points would be wise to parlay them with the UNDER.<\/p><p>The reason for this is that bettors know that the Cardinal offense can\u2019t keep up with Oregon\u2019s. If the Ducks offense has a big day, Stanford isn\u2019t likely to cover the spread as an underdog. On the other hand, if the Cardinal does cover the spread, it will likely be due to a strong defensive performance, which would lead to a cash on the UNDER.<\/p><p>This particular correlated parlay has worked well in real life. Stanford scored outright upsets in both 2012 and 2013 by scores of 17-14 and 26-20, sending both games comfortably UNDER the total. In 2015, Oregon won 45-16 as a 7-point favorite, illustrating the point that a Stanford bet was doomed in this scenario.<\/p><h2>Splitting up your Parlays for Profit<\/h2><p>One way to get more mileage out of your parlay betting is to split your favorite games up into smaller parlays.<\/p><p>For example, let\u2019s say you like Oregon, Alabama, Tulsa and Texas this week. Instead of betting a four-team parlay, you could break these four plays up into four three-teamers:<\/p><ol><li>Oregon + Alabama + Tulsa<\/li><li>Oregon + Tulsa + Texas<\/li><li>Oregon + Alabama + Texas<\/li><li>Alabama + Texas + Tulsa<\/li><\/ol><p>This way, if you go 3-1, you turn a small profit instead of seeing a four-team parlay get got like \u2013 SPOILER ALERT - Stringer at the end of Season 3. The Wire\u2019s been off the air since 2008, if you haven\u2019t seen it yet, you\u2019re never going to. Anyway, going 4-0 would pay less than the four-teamer would have, but it would still score you a very nice chunk of cash.<\/p><h2>Where to bet on College Football<\/h2><p>Now that you know what kind of parlay bets to make, it\u2019s time to actually make one. Choose a reputable sportsbook \u2013 any of the ones we mention on our Best College Football Sites page are great. We\u2019ve vetted each one to ensure that when you place a college football bet, you\u2019re in good hands.<\/p>"

The game is a little different, with a bigger field and a bigger ball and 12 men on the field instead of 11.<\/p><p>And there\u2019s also that little matter of three downs instead of four downs (leading to a lot of punting and passing every game), and CFL teams get a single point for kicking a ball through the end zone \u2013 that is, a missed field goal.<\/p><h2>CFL Fills the summer Football Void<\/h2><p>Betting on the CFL odds may be more popular early on in the season before the NFL and college football take over and dominate the football betting landscape. However, bettors shouldn\u2019t completely forget about the Canadian Football League when the summer comes to an end.<\/p><p>Once the NFL and college football seasons begin, the CFL also has to take a back seat for the oddsmakers at the sportsbooks. With the oddsmakers having less time to focus on their CFL odds and lines, it can be a good time for bettors to spot a bad line and exploit it.<\/p><h2>Watch for CFL Line Moves at Books<\/h2><p>CFL bettors should also be on the lookout for line moves. Since fewer bettors are wagering on the CFL, line moves are usually because smart money is all over one side instead of everyone simply taking the favorites as is common in NFL betting. Following smart money is usually a good move when betting on the CFL and pays off well in the long run.<\/p><p>Also, one trend that always seems to be alive year after year in the CFL is home-field advantage. Of course, some teams are better at home than others and some may be great SU but poor ATS, so always check the home and away trends carefully for every game before betting each week.<\/p>"

The smaller league size can work to the advantage of bettors who are willing to put in the time to study and learn the league.<\/p><h2>Basic Odds and Betting Options<\/h2><p>When it comes to betting on the CFL, there are different types of bets you can make. Each has its own advantages if you can handicap your bets correctly.\u00a0<\/p><ul class=\"list\"><li class=\"list__item\">Point Spread:\u00a0A point spread is used to evenly match games regardless of the two opponents that are playing. For example, a game between the Ottawa Redblacks and the Toronto Argonauts favors the Argonauts. By adding a point spread to the game of Ottawa (+9.5) vs\u00a0Toronto (-9.5), bettors who want to bet on the Argonauts at -9.5 will only win their bet if Toronto wins by 10 points or more. Ottawa +9.5 bettors cash their tickets if the Redblacks win outright or lose by nine points or less.<\/li><li class=\"list__item\">Moneyline:\u00a0In the example above, bettors would have to pay a premium to bet on Toronto to win outright at -475 (bet $475 to win $100). On the other hand, betting on an Ottawa upset would pay nicely at +380 (bet $100 to win $380).<\/li><li class=\"list__item\">Totals: Also called OVER\/UNDER, this is a bet based on a set number of points. If the point total is set at 50.5 points, a bet on the OVER cashes if 51 or more points are scored and a bet on the UNDER cashes if there are 50 points or less scored.<\/li><li class=\"list__item\">Props: These are bets on individual players, team stats and other outcomes that may not directly affect the game. Prop bets include which team will score first, how many yards will player X have, how many touchdowns will player Y have, and who will win the coin toss. Look for more props closer to Grey Cup.\u00a0<\/li><li class=\"list__item\">Futures:\u00a0These are wagers you can make on events that are going to happen such as which team will win their division, which team will win the Grey Cup and who will be named the CFL's Most Outstanding Player.<\/li><\/ul><p>Odds and spreads vary from game to game based on the talent of the two teams, home-field advantage\u00a0and other factors. Lines are set about a week before each game but can move depending on betting interest.\u00a0<\/p><h2>CFL Betting Strategies<\/h2><p>Gaining an in-depth knowledge of all nine Canadian Football League teams is totally attainable for handicappers willing to put in the work. This work can pay huge dividends on a week-to-week basis. This will also help you when it comes to betting on the Grey Cup, the CFL\u2019s equivalent of the Super Bowl.<\/p><p>With a firm understanding of each team\u2019s strengths and weaknesses on offense and defense, knowledgeable CFL bettors can project likely outcomes of each game. If a game is too close to call but will clearly be a high-scoring affair, a play on the OVER could be in order. If one side has a clear edge, a play against the spread or on the moneyline could be correct.<\/p><p>Game selection is important in CFL betting too. With so few games to choose from each week, some bettors feel inclined to bet on them all. Resist this urge and stick to sides in which you feel you have a strong edge, unless your bankroll can handle it.<\/p><h2>Finding a Suitable Sportsbook<\/h2><p>Just about all online sportsbooks offer weekly lines on CFL games. But some go beyond just that, offering prop bets on player performances or futures like season win totals. Weigh your options by reviewing the betting options that each sportsbook offers on the CFL.\u00a0<\/p><p>We\u2019ve compiled a list of the best sportsbooks for betting on the CFL and Grey Cup\u00a0to help you find an online betting site that suits your wagering needs.\u00a0<\/p>"

Here at Handspit, we don\u2019t like to toot our own horn \u2013 unless someone cuts us off on the highway \u2013 but we\u2019re experts in the field of basketball betting. In fact, we\u2019re experts in betting on every sport out there, and we want to pass our knowledge on to you so you can make smart hoops picks.<\/p><p>Whether you\u2019re looking to make a bet on a regular-season game between the Oklahoma City Thunder and Memphis Grizzlies, or on the NBA Finals, we\u2019ve got you covered with our online betting tutorial.<\/p><h2>How to Read NBA Odds<\/h2><p>Before we explain how to bet on the NBA, you should familiarize yourself with how the odds will be laid out at the sportsbook. FYI \u2013 sportsbook is the industry name for \u201cbetting site.\u201d<\/p><p>Odds will always be expressed with a plus sign (+) to designate the underdog and a minus sign (-) to represent the favorite. For instance:<\/p><p>San Antonio Spurs -110<\/p><p>Orlando Magic +110<\/p><p>The numbers beside the plus and minus sign are the actual odds. This is based on bettors making wagers of $100. The $10 is the juice or vig \u2013 what the sportsbook collects from each bet. You don\u2019t have to bet $100. You can bet $50 or $1,500 or $27. It\u2019s up to you how much you want to wager. Braces are expensive, so please bet within your means, otherwise your children will have crooked teeth.<\/p><h2>Moneyline Bets: Picking a Team to Win SU<\/h2><p>Also known as a straight-up bet (SU), the moneyline is a bet that involves picking a winner. For example, if the Toronto Raptors are the favorite in their matchup against the Boston Celtics, you can bet on them to win outright. The odds would look something like this:<\/p><p>Toronto -260<\/p><p>Boston +220<\/p><p>If you were to place $40 on the Raptors and they won, you\u2019d get a payout of $55.38 \u2013 your original $40 comes back along with the $15.38 you won. Conversely, that same $40 on a winning Celtics bet would give you a payout of $128 \u2013 your original $40 is returned, coupled with your loot of $88. Our Odds Calculator will tell you how much you\u2019d win based on the odds and how much you bet.<\/p><p>A bet on the underdog is considered a riskier wager since oddsmakers \u2013 the people who set the lines at betting sites \u2013 predict that this team isn\u2019t going to win. That\u2019s not to say that you shouldn\u2019t bet on dogs and only take faves. As long as you handicap your bets accordingly, you could see big winnings on huge upsets. Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll cover handicapping strategies below.<\/p><h2>Point Spreads: Which Squad will Cover?<\/h2><p>Like with NFL betting, when two teams aren\u2019t evenly matched, the point spread gives NBA bettors an alternative to picking one team winning over the other. The dog is given an advantage before the game starts, and the favorite is put at a disadvantage. Odds would look something like this:<\/p><p>Golden State Warriors -17.5<\/p><p>Sacramento Kings +17.5<\/p><p>In this scenario, the Kings would need to either win the game outright or lose by 17 points or less. As for the Warriors, they would need to win the game by 18 or more. When you make a bet like this, you are choosing a team to cover the spread. You\u2019ll often see ATS in association with this kind of bet. This means \u201cagainst the spread.\u201d<\/p><p>Spreads for an NBA game will typically be more than 5 points since basketball is such a high-scoring sport. There will be times when the spread won\u2019t have the decimal (.5) and you would see a whole number. Using the same example as above, if the point spread was 17 instead of 17.5 and the Warriors won the game by exactly 17 points, meaning the Kings lost by that same amount, it\u2019s called a PUSH. In this case, you\u2019d get your money back as if your bet never happened.<\/p><h2>NBA Totals: Combined Score Betting<\/h2><p>To make a totals bet, you would wager on whether the combined final score will go OVER or UNDER a set number of points. If the New Orleans Pelicans are facing off against the Houston Rockets, the odds would appear like so:<\/p><p>OVER 220<\/p><p>UNDER 220<\/p><p>If you take the OVER, it means you need the total points to be more than 220 to win your bet. If you take the UNDER, you need the collective score to be 219 or less to win your wager. PUSHES can also happen in OVER\/UNDER betting if the shared points hit the exact number set by the oddsmakers.<\/p><h2>Live Odds: Betting While the Game Progresses<\/h2><p>NBA betting sites will provide live odds while the game is going on. In-play betting lets you wager on each play, and things like the next team to score, or changing spreads. When you see live odds that you like, take them ASAP because they will disappear quickly. The faster you can make your picks on live NBA lines, the better.<\/p><h2>Prop Bets: Keeping it Light<\/h2><p>During the NBA season, you\u2019ll see prop bets. In sports betting, props (short for proposition) are wagers on the occurrence or non-occurrence of certain events or highlights that may not directly correlate to the outcome of the game. You\u2019ll see player and team props based on milestones like:<\/p><p>\u2022 How many assists will Russell Westbrook have?<\/p><p>\u2022 How many points will the Indiana Pacers put up in the first quarter against the Cleveland Cavaliers?<\/p><p>\u2022 How many rebounds will Joel Embiid have against the New York Knicks?<\/p><p>Props are considered more entertaining than other basketball bets since you don\u2019t have to worry about teams covering the spread or winning the game straight up.<\/p><h2>Futures: Betting on the Long Term<\/h2><p>NBA futures are bets made on events that will happen in time. Sure, all bets are made on happenings that have yet to occur, but futures are made weeks and months in advance of the event. At your online sportsbook of choice, you\u2019ll see bets like:<\/p><p>\u2022 Regular-season win totals per team<\/p><p>\u2022 Will Team X make the playoffs?<\/p><p>\u2022 Which team will win the championship?<\/p><p>\u2022 Who will be named Rookie of the Year?<\/p><p>\u2022 Who is the favorite to win MVP?<\/p><p>Futures bets can be made at any time before the event takes place. Oddsmakers will release odds before the season begins, so it\u2019s best to jump on them as early as possible before the lines move.<\/p><h2>Parlays: Many Bets on One Ticket<\/h2><p>This type of bet allows you to bundle two or more wagers on one betting slip. Parlays let you take the moneyline from one game, the totals from another, and the spread from a different matchup. For instance, a parlay ticket could look like this:<\/p><p>Miami Heat Moneyline + Chicago Bulls vs LA Lakers Totals + Dallas Mavericks to cover the spread<\/p><p>With this kind of bet, all wagers on your ticket must hit, otherwise it\u2019s deemed a bust. If you have even one loss, you lose the entire bet. You can also make cross-sport parlays and include college football and NHL bets with your NBA picks. In fact, you can create tickets with any sports that are played concurrently with the NBA season.<\/p><p>We have a Parlay Calculator that will show you what you\u2019d win based on the odds of each bet on your slip. Our tool lets you add up to 100 bets, however, most sportsbooks only offer up to 10-team parlays.<\/p><h2>Handicapping Your Basketball Bets<\/h2><p>When oddsmakers set the lines, they take many factors into consideration. They look at past performances, coaching\u00a0and injuries. When you handicap your bets, look at which team is playing at home. It\u2019s important to consider home-court advantage, particularly when the opposing team is on the end of a losing road trip or has played multiple games in recent nights. Fatigue can make or break a team and can affect your bets.<\/p><p>Another betting strategy to consider is momentum. When a team gets hot, it can often string together huge winning streaks both straight up and against the spread. Similarly, bad teams can rack up blowout losses in bunches as well. Be on the lookout for these spikes in season momentum and grab the odds early.<\/p><p>Finally, we have pages that can help you make smart bets:<\/p><p>\u2022 Betting Trends \u2013 How a team performs historically ATS, SU<\/p><p>\u2022 Consensus \u2013 Which side the betting public is looking to back<\/p><p>\u2022 Free Picks \u2013 See what our Super Computer predicts<\/p><p>\u2022 Stats \u2013 How a team performs on Offense and Defense <\/p><p>\u2022 Referee Data \u2013 How those in stripes can shift the game with a single call<\/p><p>\u2022 Database \u2013 How a squad performs as a home team\/on the road, as a dog\/fave<\/p><p>\u2022 Standings \u2013 Where does a team sit compared to the rest of the league<\/p><p>\u2022 Team Reports \u2013 Injuries, field-goal percentage and everything else you need for betting<\/p><p>\u2022 Power Rankings \u2013 A week-to-week look at each squad<\/p><h2>Where to Bet on the NBA<\/h2><p>Now that you know how to bet on basketball, you\u2019ll need to find somewhere to place your bets.

                        "content": "<p>Think of how you are when you don\u2019t get enough sleep. There isn\u2019t enough coffee in the world to get you through the day. Now imagine you\u2019re an NBA player. Once you get past the nice cars, big houses and million-dollar sneaker deals, think about having to get back on the court after not only a loss but after playing three games in a row out of town. It\u2019s not a good look.<\/p><p>Toronto is known as \u201cWhite Vegas\u201d in NBA circles because of its fun party environment. This can cause teams to play worse when they visit Canada\u2019s version of Sin City, leaving the Raptors no choice but to destroy their opponents on the court \u2026 sometimes.<\/p><p>The ability to handicap fatigue level for both teams and players in the NBA could be the difference between you winning and losing money on your basketball bets. There are times during the season when teams play three games in four nights \u2013 and in some cases, four games in five nights \u2013 making the amount of energy they have left in the tank critical in determining whether a team covers the spread or implodes.<\/p><h2>Handicap NBA Schedules Closely<\/h2><p>It\u2019s important to handicap each NBA team\u2019s schedule and look for spots where they might be tired. If you see a team at the tail end of a four-games-in-five-nights stretch, they could very well become fade material \u2013 when you bet against them. You should also look out for teams that are well-rested. A team that has a chance to recoup after a road trip and play their next few games at home is a favorite to consider betting on.<\/p><p>Keep in mind, that it\u2019s not just physical fatigue that matters, but also mental fatigue. For example, heading into a four-game road trip, a team might have a simple goal of earning a split. If that team has overperformed like a B-list celebrity singing the national anthem at the All-Star Game, and goes into the finale at 2-1 straight-up through the first three, they could be ripe for a letdown spot in the last game of the swing.<\/p><p>It\u2019s rare for a team to play well in every game of a road trip during a difficult stretch. NBA players are professionals making tons of money, but they\u2019re people too. They can\u2019t play their best all the time, no matter how much you yell at them on Twitter. Even star players like Bill Russell \u2013 ask your dad \u2013 had to pace themselves for a grueling season. The winning team against the spread will be the one that best manages player minutes and adjusts their strategy according to their opponent.<\/p><h2>Good Basketball Teams Succumb to Fatigue Too<\/h2><p>Good teams can also disappoint and fail to cover the spread due to the rigors of the regular season. A strong team like the Golden State Warriors or Los Angeles Lakers \u2013 with LeBron \u2013 could head into a game as a huge favorite at the end of a long road trip according to the NBA betting odds and only do just enough to win the game outright, but fail to cover the spread.<\/p><p>Keep in mind that oddsmakers factor in travel schedules when setting the point spread. You shouldn\u2019t automatically bet against a team because they\u2019re in the middle of a long road trip. Teams with better coaching staff are more equipped to plan for fatigue situations by managing player minutes and rotations. By learning how to handicap these potential NBA fatigue situations like a good coach does, you can avoid the common pitfalls that could damage your bankroll.<\/p>"

The point spread is a number set by oddsmakers to give bettors a chance to wager on either side of the game. Instead of making a moneyline bet where you would simply pick a winner, the point spread allows you to wager on how many points the favorite is going to win by or how many points the underdog can lose by and still cover the spread.<\/p><p>An NBA point spread at the sportsbook would look something like this:<\/p><p>Boston Celtics -7<\/p><p>Toronto Raptors +7<\/p><p>The favorite is represented by the minus sign (-), whereas the underdog is represented by the plus sign (+). In this case, the Celtics would have to win by more than seven points to cover the spread or the Raptors would have to win the game or not lose by more than six. If the Celtics win by exactly seven, it would be a PUSH and your bet would be refunded.<\/p><h2>Betting the NBA Point Spread<\/h2><p>Sometimes it will appear that every NBA team is close to .500 both against the spread and on the totals board. This may seem discouraging but oddsmakers know what they\u2019re doing. Sportsbooks are using their best guys to set NBA betting lines. That doesn\u2019t mean betting the basketball point spread isn\u2019t a good idea.<\/p><h2>How Difficult is it to Beat the Spread?<\/h2><p>The nature of the NBA game can make betting on the sport difficult. With so much scoring involved, even the best handicapping strategy can blow up in garbage time by something as simple and frustrating as an uncontested three at the buzzer in a game that\u2019s already been decided.<\/p><p>That said, there are ways to beat the NBA game and clean up on the point spread.<\/p><p>Here\u2019s how you do it:<\/p><ol><li>Stay locked on Handspit\u2019s NBA pages for odds, free picks and betting news<\/li><li>Research both teams in the matchup to see if they have a history of covering the spread \u2013 this info can be found on our NBA Standings page<\/li><li>Control your bankroll by wagering smaller amounts until you get the hang of NBA point spread betting<\/li><li>Shop the lines at different sportsbooks to see who is offering the most favorable odds<\/li><\/ol>"

At Handspit, we are betting experts which means the strategies we present here can actually work out for your bankroll if you follow them correctly.<\/p><h2>Betting Against Big Favorites<\/h2><p>A general rule of thumb is to avoid big favorites, because they tend to be overvalued or inflated due to public perception. Fading is when bet on the other side of a matchup. When a team is upwards of 10-point chalk against the NBA point spread, things can go wrong. Chalk is another way to say \u201cfavorite\u201d and if you fade big favorites you could end up with a nice payout on your wager if you do your research.<\/p><p>Always make sure to see how teams fare as big favorites and how their opponent does as a big underdog. Do they allow the other team to score enough garbage time points to cover the spread? Do they take their foot off the gas and pull their starters early after securing a big lead?<\/p><p>NBA teams, especially those with their eye on the finals \u2013 which should be all teams unless you\u2019re the Washington Wizards \u2013 BOOM ROASTED \u2013 care little about style points and by how much they should win a given game. The San Antonio Spurs could be listed as 13-point favorites at home against the Dallas Mavericks, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re going to need those 13 points to win. They could win by five and call it a night. You have to research both teams in the matchup to know if Dallas is going to allow for San Antonio to keep a 13-point lead.<\/p><h2>Betting the Moneyline on Small to Medium Underdogs<\/h2><p>Moneyline bets on small to medium underdogs can be profitable over the long haul, particularly if you\u2019re looking at home dogs. Home court advantage is important and when you couple it with uneven matchups and situations like fatigue, the home dogs can be ripe for the betting. Even if the home underdog is coming off a road trip, there\u2019s still the chance that they could be a safe bet at home. Make sure you look at our NBA pages for betting news, free picks, odds and everything else you need to make a smart basketball bets on underdogs.<\/p><h2>Home\/Road Splits and Momentum<\/h2><p>How an NBA team performs on the road can be vastly different to how they perform at home. These wide variations in performance from home to road are why you should consider home\/road splits as a handicapping tool. Knowing which teams overperform either at home or on the road can go a long way in procuring a sizeable bankroll over the season.<\/p><p>Another NBA betting theory is to consider NBA runs, aka momentum swings. Is a team prone to going on late-game scoring sprees? Can their opponent stop the run? Looking at how successful teams are when they get momentum can help you when betting live. In-play NBA wagering can take you beyond traditional moneyline bets if you can predict how well a team will do when they go on a momentum tear.<\/p><p>NBA betting theories aren\u2019t infallible but you can make some nice cash if you follow what we\u2019ve laid out above.<\/p>"

                        "content": "<p>If you\u2019ve ever watched an NBA game or played basketball, you know that this sport more than any other is a game of scoring runs \u2013 due to its high scoring nature. Momentum can swing from one side to another within a matter of minutes, and the ability to predict when a run will happen can help bettors profit when wagering on a live NBA game.<\/p><h2>What is a Run in Basketball?<\/h2><p>When you hear the announcer say, \u201cThe Indiana Pacers have been on a 13-2 run in the last two minutes,\u201d it means they\u2019ve scored scored a bunch in the last 120 seconds and their opponent has not scored as much or at all. Generally, when NBA teams go on runs, the team that can score in bunches while shutting down their opponent in certain periods of the game is going to etither win the game or cover the spread.<\/p><p>An example of a run would be Tracy McGrady in a regular season game against the Spurs in 2007. McGrady put up 13 points in 33 seconds. Most of us can\u2019t even tie our shoes in 33 seconds, yet Tracy inspired the Rockets to win the game 81-80 with his momentum.<\/p><h2>Should you Ride Momentum Swings in NBA Games?<\/h2><p>The only way to ride momentum swings during an NBA game is to bet on the matchup live. Since in-play wagering is a growing element of the NBA betting odds landscape, predicting streaks before they happen is obviously critical, so you can make money on the right side at the right time.<\/p><p>There are a number of handicapping factors that need to be considered when trying to predict whether a team is going to run or not. Hot shooting is literally hit-or-miss, as sometimes it can continue for a long stretch of time when one or more players keep making baskets \u2013 not actually weaving a basket but getting the ball through the hoop. Other times, the momentum starts but ends as quickly as it came with a few poor shots \u2013 looking at you Marcus Smart.<\/p><p>However, matchups, game situations, foul trouble, strategic changes and substitutions, among other things, also play key roles in determining a team\u2019s momentum. Determining whether the momentum is sustainable is the only way to handicap basketball runs. More on that below.<\/p><h2>Defense Matters as much as Offense<\/h2><p>One common misconception about momentum is that teams go on runs because they start lighting it up from the outside \u2013 which would be a great title for an NBA player\u2019s memoir. That is only partially true because defense is equally important in this scenario. Of course, teams have to score to go on a run. But, most of the time it is because they\u2019ve stepped it up on the defensive end as well since a defense that forces turnovers usually leads to fast breaks and open shots.<\/p><p>Another thing to remember is that sometimes it is smart \u2013 not Marcus Smart \u2013 to bet against the team with momentum unless there is an obvious reason to stay the course or stay away from fading on a live wager. Runs do not last forever and value can be had wagering on the team that is struggling at the time.<\/p><p>Momentum goes both ways, and it usually is only a matter of time before the team puts a stop to the bleeding and fights back with a run of its own.<\/p><p>Timing is everything \u2013 which is another great title for a memoir \u2013 and winning live NBA bets still need to be handicapped accordingly.

A lot of bettors have a favorite team that they consider their best betting option regardless whether or not that team is a contender, which is why bettors should always pay close attention and understand how much effect NCAA basketball rankings have on the odds.<\/p><p>Sportsbooks know certain teams are more popular with the public than others, and oddsmakers often shade lines in their favor trying to get bettors to lay more points. This in turn, makes it even harder for bettors to win. However, there is hope. You can still make smart picks without relying heavily on the NCAA basketball rankings.<\/p><h2>College Basketball Rankings Measure Public Opinion<\/h2><p>Public opinions are like ears, we each have two and sometimes they get blocked and we mishear what\u2019s being said. For this reason, public opinion isn\u2019t all that it\u2019s cracked up to be when it comes to betting on college hoops. Once you figure out that oddsmakers are sometimes shading their lines, you can compare their numbers with your own power rankings, and determine where the most value on teams are.<\/p><p>There are different NCAA basketball rankings but the most well-known are the AP Top 25 and the Coaches\u2019 Poll, both of which rely on facts and subjectivity. Some voters have seen the teams, know the win-loss records and use qualitative factors to determine the rankings. However, preseason expectations and traditional program prominence can push teams much higher or lower than they should be. Since the voters are regionally based, there will more than likely be some sort of home team bias affecting their personal rankings.<\/p><p>Overall, the voters do not do a poor job, but following subjective analysis won\u2019t be enough if you are betting on college basketball with the intent of making a profit. Wagers can be won or lost by a few points, so bettors need to know with better certainty where schools really stack up based on more accurate analytics and stats.<\/p><h2>Odds and Handicapping Database<\/h2><p>Instead, use our college basketball database to handicap your bets. This will help you avoid falling into the pit of subjectivity provided by the rankings trap. For example, when the 23rd-ranked team in the AP Top 25 plays and unranked opponent on the road as an underdog, the assumption is that there is value on the ranked team. However, that may not be the case. If you use our database you can see how both teams fared in their last matchups. NCAA basketball rankings are less important than a comprehensive database that goes back 30 games like ours does.<\/p><p>College basketball rankings won\u2019t help you beat the sportsbook because the house always finds some way to win. Do not underestimate the oddsmakers who made the ranked team an underdog because they are ranked No. 40. At the same time, a ranked road team can also be a good underdog bet if they are playing an overrated unranked school with a big name. In any case, make sure you do your homework beyond the polls before laying down your money at the sportsbook.<\/p><p>The key to winning more college basketball wagers is avoiding the rankings trap when you\u2019re handicapping the teams and their upcoming matchups. Our NCAA basketball pages can help you with that. We have betting news, free picks, that database we mentioned above and anything else you\u2019d need to make smart college hoops bets.<\/p>"

Lack of history between the schools and\/or roster turnover from the previous season \u2013 when seniors graduate or lucky players get drafted into the NBA \u2013 makes handicapping these games difficult.<\/p><p>Beware of the mid-major with something to prove in non-conference games.

Winning more college basketball bets requires an understanding of the difference between handicapping college basketball conference vs non-conference games.<\/p><h2>NCAA Basketball Betting and Home-Court Advantage<\/h2><p>Home-court advantage is huge in college basketball, whether it\u2019s a non-conference or conference matchup. Teams that travel are more prone to fatigue and are often worth fading. Home teams have the backing of their fans and school spirit which can not only give them more energy, but they\u2019re also well-rested because they didn\u2019t have to travel for the game.<\/p><p>Now that you have a better understanding of how to bet on conference vs non-conference college basketball games, check out our NCAAB picks to help shape your wagers.<\/p>"

They are also an important part about college basketball wagering, especially if you can handicap a rivalry game properly. Rivals in college basketball usually play each other once or twice each season unless they meet up again later in a conference tournament or NCAA Tournament.<\/p><p>A number of handicapping factors need to be considered before betting on rivalries, including returning players\u2019 experiences, fan intensity and media hype. Below, we\u2019ll give you an idea of how to handicap a rivalry game so you can (hopefully) win your NCAA basketball wagers.<\/p><h2>Home-Court is an Advantage in Rivalry Games<\/h2><p>Emotions are arguably the biggest factor in rivalry games, and you as a bettor will have the edge if you take them into account and handicap them accordingly. Home-court advantage can have a great impact on rivalry games, as the frenzied fans bring added motivation to their team. This also brings increased nerves to the visiting team causing them to crumble like a sand castle in the rain. Normally, home-court advantage is worth 3-4 points to the spread, but in rivalry games the effect can end up being much greater than that.<\/p><p>In the Duke-North Carolina rivalry, the Blue Devils get a huge boost from Cameron Indoor Stadium. Some even argue that their fans \u2013 also known as the Cameron Crazies \u2013 give Duke the biggest home-court advantage in college basketball. Always make sure to take that into consideration when laying down your wager in those rivalry games.<\/p><h2>Past History is Important<\/h2><p>History can tell us a lot about a rivalry matchup. Look at recent meetings and the progression of the schools involved in the rivalry throughout the season. Do not throw out your regular handicapping regimen just because this is a rivalry game either. Be sure to look at the history of the rivalry and how the two teams involved have played against each other in the past.<\/p><p>Because there is such high turnover in college basketball, it can be rare for star players to be part of a rivalry for more than one year. Seniors graduate, excellent players are NBA-bound and Jake Shuttlesworth convinces his son Jesus Shuttlesworth to play for Big State. However, if there are star players, it\u2019s worth looking at how they performed in rivalry games past.<\/p><p>Breaking down how the two teams have moved through their respective schedules is necessary as well before betting on a rivalry game. Has one team matured and improved, or have they changed strategies and lineups since the previous meeting?<\/p><p>In college basketball, a school can improve dramatically over the course of only a few months, going from a team outside the NCAA Tournament field to a National Championship contender after the conference slate begins.<\/p><p>If you become an expert at betting on college basketball rivalries, you will end up winning some of your NCAA basketball wagers. Just remember home-court is critical, and paying close attention to betting line moves leading up to game time is essential.

A school can be a monster on the season, but if they racked up most of their success because of their dominance at home, they could be overvalued in the NCAA Tournament.<\/p><p>Of the pairings, focus on the No. 5 seed vs\u00a0No. 12 seed matchups. For whatever reason, around a third of the No. 12 seeds have won their opening games against No. 5 seeds, making them good bets ATS at the same time. Usually at least one No. 12 will win outright, and these schools often have up to 10 points with which to work on the point spread.<\/p><p>Lower seeds at No. 10, No. 11, No. 12\u00a0and even at No. 13 can be solid wagers ATS as underdogs, especially if they\u2019re champions from mid-major conferences going up against a non-champion from one of the power conferences. These schools are champs for a reason, and the gap between the conferences is smaller than ever, especially in a one-game, winner-take-all format on a neutral site.<\/p><h2>Side With Small Favorites at Tourney<\/h2><p>Generally speaking, side with small favorites, especially if they\u2019re the lower seed. As well, make sure to handicap conference strength, and don\u2019t discount the power of momentum. Teams playing well heading into the big dance are likely to keep it going, while schools limping in are primed to fizzle out early.<\/p><p>Winning more March Madness bets is not an easy task, given that there are so many games in such a short period of time. And it takes college basketball handicapping savvy to know how to manage your bankroll (while you win your bracket game as well).<\/p>"

That 1-30 record was \u2026 something. Don\u2019t be like the Highlanders. You can win by learning how to properly handicap games by focusing on small conferences.<\/p><h2>College Basketball Small Conference Betting<\/h2><p>For sportsbooks, the struggle is real. There are over 300 schools at the Division I-level, and oddsmakers need to make lines for every single game played. Their focus is obviously on the bigger ranked games between the likes of Duke, Kentucky and other top schools. But, they also have to make lines for smaller schools that don\u2019t receive a lot media coverage.<\/p><p>Big schools have to face small schools on an annual basis to fill out their schedules, which puts oddsmakers in a tough spot. Sportsbooks often want to give bettors the opportunity to take advantage of soft lines due to the number of smaller conferences in college basketball, including mid-majors. It's not realistic to expect oddsmakers to put as much attention to detail into every college basketball matchup, leaving many games ripe for the picking.<\/p><h2>Smaller Conferences = Betting Edge<\/h2><p>On any given Saturday during college hoops season, there are upwards of 125 games on the betting slate. Since oddsmakers have to focus on the bigger conferences like the ACC and SEC, bettors who focus on smaller conferences and specialize in betting their games can have an edge. As part of your NCAA basketball betting strategy, it\u2019s wise to pick one or two smaller conferences to follow like the Horizon League or Colonial Athletic Association. Spotting betting value with smaller conferences isn\u2019t rocket science if you get to know those teams, the players, the rivalries and history, and home\/road splits.<\/p><h2>Take Advantage of Stagnant Lines<\/h2><p>Unlike the highly public games of the power conferences, the lines set for smaller conference matchups do not move nearly as much because there is much less public action. If you see a betting line or total that you like, chances are you will be able to wager on that number throughout the week. With bigger conference games, the lines will move like they\u2019re doing the conga at a Bar Mitzvah and you\u2019ll need to jump on them early. With smaller conferences you have more time to handicap your bets and can take the lines hours before the game if you want to.<\/p><p>While sportsbooks often have the house edge, you can have an advantage in being able to pick one game out of 125 on the NCAA hoops odds menu. By focusing on smaller conferences and mid-majors, you\u2019ll usually find softer lines that stay put throughout the week which could lead you to winning more bets.<\/p>"

Outside of those fans and sharps who follow NCAA hoops religiously, many let a golden wagering opportunity pass them by simply because the games take place during the heart of football season.<\/p><h2>Preseason Tournaments Offer Betting Value<\/h2><p>You cannot beat the sportsbooks if you are not playing these winnable games, so pay close attention to preseason tournaments knowing oddsmakers are so busy with the NFL and college football that the college basketball lines tend to be softer at this time of year.<\/p><p>Remember, value is there if you know where to look, and preseason tournaments are also the perfect time to start handicapping teams for the season ahead, both in terms of conference play and down the road in the NCAA Tournament.<\/p><p>In addition, betting preseason tournament games gives you an excellent chance to see where teams are in relation to the preseason hype and expectations. The preseason tournaments often serve up some intriguing matchups between elite programs from different conferences, giving you something on which to lean during March Madness.<\/p><h2>Study Coaches and Players Early in the Season<\/h2><p>In order to bet successfully on preseason tournaments, there are a few things to handicap beforehand. Start with looking at the head coaches, especially the new ones taking over downtrodden programs who are looking to hit the ground running and make an instant favorable impression with their players and the fans.<\/p><p>Backing these teams can pay dividends early on in preseason tournaments when the new winning attitude the coaches are trying to instil\u00a0is first taking shape.<\/p><p>At the same time, schools with most of their starters returning tend to perform well in preseason tournaments as well because they are already familiar with each other. Veteran teams in college basketball are rare because so many star players leave school early for the NBA on an annual basis, so if you have the chance to take a senior-laden team in a preseason tourney game, it will more than likely pay off with a winning bet.<\/p><h2>Don\u2019t Overpay When Wagering on Popular Schools<\/h2><p>Finally, remember that public programs are always overvalued by oddsmakers because bettors love them. Regardless of where Duke, North Carolina, Kansas and Kentucky and similar schools sit in terms of actual talent, they will always be supported by the betting public. Sportsbooks obviously know that and make bettors pay a higher price.<\/p><p>You can never start your homework too early in trying to win more NCAA basketball bets this year. Solid betting strategies begin with handicapping teams and games in November and December and build throughout the season. The earlier, the better off you and your bankroll will be by the time the NCAA Tournament tips off in March, when even more money can be made betting on college basketball if you know your stuff.<\/p>"

With the NBA, college hoops\u00a0and the NFL, you usually don\u2019t want your money to follow the line movements. If a line moves in any of those sports, it\u2019s because the public is behind it \u2014 and no offense to the public but usually they bet with their hearts more than with their brains.<\/p><p>Since the WNBA betting pool is so much smaller, when a WNBA line moves that usually means there\u2019s smart money behind it. If someone is betting on the WNBA, they\u2019re usually taking their time to make smart bets with information backing them.<\/p><p>Because of this, whenever you see a WNBA line move at a sportsbook, that tends to mean that\u2019s where the educated bettors are going and you should jump on board before the oddsmakers really figure out what\u2019s going on and move the line even more and break up any advantage you might have had.<\/p><h2>Take Advantage of the Sportsbooks<\/h2><p>It isn\u2019t often that sportsbooks make mistakes with their odds, but if it\u2019s going to happen, a low-profile league like the WNBA \u2014\u00a0where the books aren\u2019t spending a lot of time \u2014\u00a0is where it\u2019s going to occur the most.

Betting on baseball during the playoffs is like going to a buffet. You need to strategically plan each plate otherwise you\u2019re going to get full too fast on that weird pasta salad with the ham cubes.<\/p><p>Over the course of the long 162-game regular season, it is possible to identify betting trends and betting opportunities for a certain club, based on the success of the club\u2019s starters, bullpen strategy and offensive production in certain situations.<\/p><p>All of those factors can change in the post-season as teams usually shift to four-starter pitching rotations, which in turn, impacts the dynamics of a club\u2019s bullpen.<\/p><h2>Baseball Bettors: Do Your Homework<\/h2><p>And you thought you were done with homework! Don\u2019t sweat it. Handspit has basically done the research for you. All you have to do is check out our MLB online resources. We track how many runs a team scores with specific starters on the mound, while comparing those numbers to the hurler\u2019s regular season ERA. A club\u2019s historical record in the playoffs is also crucial information to have on hand when wagering on MLB post-season games.<\/p><p>The Handspit MLB Team Reports include complete regular season and post-season game logs for all 30 MLB clubs, while our MLB Database enables sports bettors to review the head-to-head records of opposing clubs in both regular season and post-season contests. Our database also allows you to see how starters have done vs any team in the regular or post-season both on the road and at home.<\/p><h2>Watch for a Playoff Line Movement<\/h2><p>Sports bettors must also look for dramatic betting line movement on MLB post-season games. Playoff games see more action from the public and that can lead to wide and rapid swings in game betting lines. A useful tool to track this is the Line History feature on Handspit baseball game line pages. These pages show betting line movement from opening to right before the first pitch at multiple online sportsbooks.<\/p><h2>Don\u2019t Forget about the Runline<\/h2><p>Baseball\u2019s post-season also gives new life to runline betting. Although the runline sounds like a movie from the early 90s starring Jean Claude Van Damme and Damon Wayons as two renegade cops trying to stop the villain, played by Dennis Hopper, from poisoning the water supply, the runline can be a very profitable MLB post-season wager to make. Real opportunity can exist to boost the value of favorites using runline odds if you think they\u2019re going to blow the other team out.<\/p><h2>Momentum Can Play a Major Role<\/h2><p>Often, the momentum behind a team of destiny can provide a guide for sports bettors wagering on the MLB post-season. A total of six wild card teams have won the World Series, and most of these wins were at the expense of teams who owned strong records and top futures odds. Remember the 1997 and 2003 Marlins\u2019 squads who overcame the odds and won the World Series? Edgar Renteria and Josh Beckett sure do.<\/p><p>Consistent pitching, offensive production, staying healthy and getting hot at the right time can have as much to do with World Series success as any other statistics. Understanding how these factors carry over or change from the regular season is important in developing a strong MLB playoff betting strategy.<\/p><p>Besides the pages we\u2019ve linked to above, the following will help you make smart post-season baseball wagers:<\/p>Other MLB Post-Season Handicapping Pages<ul class=\"list\"><li class=\"list__item\">Odds<\/li><li class=\"list__item\">Picks<\/li><li class=\"list__item\">Pitcher Run Support<\/li><li class=\"list__item\">Pitcher Money Won\/Lost<\/li><\/ul>"

                        "content": "<p>Most team sports have a key position player where performance can make the difference between winning or losing a game. In hockey, there is no position more important than goalie, while in football, teams live and die based on the strength of their quarterback. In baseball, no single position impacts the game more than the person responsible for filling the Gatorade dispenser. Jokes! It\u2019s the starting pitcher. It\u2019s always the starting pitcher.<\/p><h2>How to Handicap Starting Pitchers<\/h2><p>There are many factors to consider when handicapping a starting pitcher. Both standard stats as well as some advanced analytics apply. Look to a pitcher\u2019s recent performance, his past performances vs a particular opponent, how that opened fares vs right-handed or left-handed pitching and how hot that team has been offensively. Other stats to consider are ERA, strike-out-to-walk ratio (K\/BB) and a more advanced stat that baseball bettors are catching on to is FIP (fielding independent pitching).<\/p><p>You\u2019ll also want to keep in mind that pitcher can\u2019t win without run support. Look how the team has performed offensively and how they\u2019ve done against the opposing pitcher. Check out the team\u2019s overall record in games that the starter is pitching in. An example would be Jacob deGrom in 2108. He was one of the best pitchers in the league but failed to get run support from his teammates. deGrom did however, get a haircut.<\/p><h2>What About the Rest of the Pitching Staff?<\/h2><p>In the past, the focus was almost exclusively on starting pitchers because you knew when Justin Verlander was on the mound, you were going to get seven or eight quality innings. Starters were given four days off and expected to perform at a high-caliber level all season otherwise they would lose their rotation spot to some wide-eyed kid.<\/p><p>Fast-forward a few years to the late twenty-tens when pitch counts are all the rage and younger pitchers are making their MLB debuts every six seconds. These newbies are making their introductions on strict pitch counts, and hurlers in the bullpen are now specializing in middle relief, setup and closing. This leaves starters to pitch fewer innings per game than ever before, in turn, making baseball betting more challenging.<\/p><p>Shorter appearances by starters has also increased the popularity of five-inning game betting lines, where MLB moneylines, totals and runlines are set based on the first five innings of a contest, when a starter is most likely to be on the mound.<\/p><p>If you prefer to stick to traditional betting instead of the first five innings, look to the bullpen and see how\u2019s they've performed in recent games against certain opponents.<\/p><h2>Pitching Resources at Handspit<\/h2><p>Often, novice baseball bettors will look to a starter\u2019s overall stats as a guide to betting on the games. However, to fully understand what a starter brings to the mound, it is important to understand the pitcher\u2019s recent performance, home\/road and stadium splits, and historical trends vs their opponent. You should also consider injuries, streaks, weather and of course, the odds.<\/p><p>Like in the best baseball movie of all time, Bull Durham, when Crash Davis told Nuke LaLoosh to use clich\u00e9s in interviews, Handspit wants you to use the top handicapping tools for starting pitchers. We have a number of resources available to help you with your research on today\u2019s probable starters. We\u2019re just happy to be here to help the ball club.

Wrong movie.<\/p>MLB Pitcher Betting Pages<ul class=\"list\"><li class=\"list__item\">Pitcher Logs: These logs cover every starter in baseball, complete with their stats from each start, the OVER\/UNDER in each, and the how profitable that pitcher has been for bettors.<\/li><li class=\"list__item\">Probable Pitchers: Here you\u2019ll find a pitcher\u2019s ERA, handedness, and record.<\/li><li class=\"list__item\">Pitcher Run Support: This page analyzes the average number of runs scored by a pitcher\u2019s team over each start, as well as each pitcher\u2019s win\/loss record and ERA on the season.<\/li><li class=\"list__item\">Pitcher Money Won\/Lost: Here we track how much money a pitcher generates on the MLB money line, regardless \u2013 or irregardless as they say in Red Sox country \u2013 of their win\/loss record.<\/li><li class=\"list__item\">Database: Our Database allows you to look up how the pitcher has performed at home, on the road, as a favorite, an underdog, vs any opponent in any month and more.<\/li><\/ul><p>Handspit also provides betting previews on all aspects of each game, including recent head-to-head matchups between teams, details on the last three starts of each team\u2019s probable pitcher, as well as details on each probable pitcher\u2019s recent starts vs that day\u2019s opponent.<\/p><h2>What About the Intangibles?<\/h2><p>While the above analysis is beneficial, a sense of the intangibles is also critical. Sometimes, a team has a pitcher\u2019s number, or pitching in a certain stadium inexplicably spells trouble for an individual hurler \u2013 like how Citi Field is a left-handed hitter\u2019s paradise or how the elevation and expansive dimensions at Coors Field are responsible for more runs scored. There\u2019s also a Shake Shack inside Citi Field with crazy lineups that don\u2019t make sense until you eat the burger and are like \u201cWHOA. Now, that\u2019s a burger.\u201d<\/p><p>Successful baseball betting requires in-depth knowledge of starting pitchers and bullpens, including insight that often only comes from watching the games.

                        "content": "<p>During the summer months, baseball takes center stage, offering bettors and sports fans alike a variety of unique wagering opportunities and live odds. A successful MLB betting strategy considers the performance of starting pitchers and bullpens, team home\/away records and head-to-head records, score potential, and what to expect from each team\u2019s offense.<\/p><p>With baseball lines available daily, both novice and hard-core sports betting fans can get in on the action \u2013 and with our help, betting trends and a little score watching,\u00a0you can make educated picks. Ray Liotta\u2019s ghost once told Kevin Costner, \u201cif you build it, they will come.\u201d\u00a0Here at Handspit, we say, \u201cif you bet it, you could win.\u201d<\/p><h2>Betting on the Moneyline<\/h2><p>In all sports whether it\u2019s baseball, hockey or UFC, a moneyline bet involves picking an outright winner, aka who will have the highest score. However, like everything in life, this bet comes with a price. Betting on a moneyline favorite always pays less than winning a bet on an underdog, no matter which sportsbook you use.<\/p><p>In betting, favorites are always shown with the minus sign (-) and underdogs are shown with the plus sign (+).<\/p><p>Let\u2019s say the Boston Red Sox are hosting the Chicago White Sox in a battle of the socks. A game line would look something like this:<\/p><p>Boston -200<\/p><p>Chicago +170<\/p><p>The above game line means a bet on the favored Red Sox would cost you $200 to win $100. On the other hand, a White Sox underdog win would give you $170 on a $100 wager.<\/p><p>You can use our Odds Calculator to determine what you would win based on your wager amount. You\u2019ll also be able to tell what a win on the underdog vs favorite will give you depending on the sportsbook\u2019s odds. With even the best baseball teams typically losing about 40 percent\u00a0of their regular-season games, frequently picking big favorites can be risky for novice bettors.<\/p><p>Handicapping small favorites and underdogs, particularly home underdogs, while watching out for good pitchers on bad teams, can go a long way in helping you steadily build your bankroll. Think of the 2018 Mets and how they had one of the best pitchers in the game (Jacob deGrom) but could not give him any run support at all.<\/p><h2>The Runline<\/h2><p>The MLB runline is baseball\u2019s version of the point spread where you get a 1.5-run spread on a game. An example of a runline would be:<\/p><p>New York -1.5 +110<\/p><p>Toronto +1.5 -140<\/p><p>While the Yankees may be -200 moneyline favorites to defeat the Blue Jays, their odds of winning by 1.5 or more runs could be dramatically higher and may even make them underdogs. The Blue Jays could lose the game by a run but pay off as a favorite on the runline. The number (1.5) is set by oddsmakers based on the normal score of a baseball game where teams generally win or lose by two runs.<\/p><h2>First Five Innings Betting<\/h2><p>During the regular season, especially in April and May, it can take baseball teams time to find their groove. Young players get called up, new managers learn the ropes and seasoned vets can have slow starts, turning a typical matchup into a tumultuous affair that can have an effect on the score of the game and your betting strategy.<\/p><p>Part of your baseball betting strategy should involve looking at the bullpen. So, if a team has a horrible bullpen, you only need to worry about the active starting pitcher for five innings for this type of bet. Instead of wagering on the game\u2019s outcome straight up, you can bet on the first five innings of a ball game. Generally called F5 bets at the sportsbook, this is like a moneyline bet except you\u2019re only betting on the first five innings of the game. If you\u2019re only handicapping the starting pitchers, then there\u2019s less risk vs handicapping the entire game.<\/p><h2>Betting MLB Totals<\/h2><p>MLB totals betting allows you to wager on the total number of runs that will be scored by both teams in a game. Oddsmakers establish a betting line representing the total, giving bettors the option to wager on the OVER or UNDER.<\/p><p>Let\u2019s pretend the Dodgers are playing the Rockies. Totals bet odds would appear like this:<\/p><p>OVER 10.5<\/p><p>UNDER 10.5<\/p><p>In this example, the total is set at 10.5. If you think the combined number of runs scored by both teams will be 11 or more, you would bet the OVER. If you think the score will be 10 or less, you would bet the UNDER. One thing for bettors to understand is that oddsmakers take into account factors like ballparks. Oddsmakers always consider locations like Coors Field (where the ball travels further) and Wrigley Field (where wind often has an impact)\u00a0and work them into the set total for the game.<\/p><h2>Baseball Futures<\/h2><p>Futures betting is available all year long. During the offseason, the 162-game season, the pennant races and the postseason, sports bettors can wager on which team will be crowned the World Series champion and which teams will be\u00a0league pennant winners and division title winners.<\/p><p>The great thing about MLB betting, besides winning a few bucks, is that there are so many options available when it comes to future odds that you can make picks on just about anything. You can bet on team win totals or if they will go OVER or UNDER the oddsmaker\u2019s\u00a0set number. You can also make player-specific futures bets like who will win MVP, who will be the home-run leader, which pitcher will win the Cy Young, and who will eat the most seeds during the course of the season. OK, we made up the last one, but in a perfect world, a sportsbook would offer odds on that.<\/p><h2>Prop Bets<\/h2><p>Prop betting allows you to wager on very specific instances, especially during the playoffs. You can make individual bets on players. Will their total number\u00a0of hits be OVER or UNDER the oddsmaker\u2019s set number? Other examples would be:<\/p><ul class=\"list\"><li class=\"list__item\">How many RBIs will a certain player have?<\/li><li class=\"list__item\">How many bases will a certain player steal?<\/li><li class=\"list__item\">How many home runs will a certain player have?<\/li><li class=\"list__item\">How many strikeouts will a certain pitcher have?<\/li><\/ul><p>We provide umpire stats which can be useful when it comes to player props. Knowing how an umpire controls a game lets you know if they\u2019re prone to calling more strikeouts, which can hamper the number of hits.<\/p><h2>Baseball Parlays<\/h2><p>Parlays can be a baseball bettor\u2019s best friend or worst nightmare. This type of bet allows you to combine two or more bets on the same ticket (point spread\/runline, totals, moneylines), netting more money than you would on a single wager. However, all picks must hit otherwise your entire parlay ticket is a bust.<\/p><h2>Live Odds<\/h2><p>Bettors wagering on baseball want to win. However, sometimes you make a bet on your favorite team and you notice that it\u2019s the top of the seventh and they\u2019re not going to win you any money. When this happens, look for live odds at your sportsbook to make an in-play bet. Odds will be available for plate appearances, home runs, which base a batter will get on, and the number of strikeouts a pitcher will throw during any given inning. If a bullpen phenom comes on in\u00a0the top of the eighth and you think he\u2019ll have at least two strikeouts, why not make an in-play bet on him?<\/p><h2>What is the Best Baseball Betting Strategy?<\/h2><p>The best betting strategies for wagering on Major League Baseball involve a basic knowledge of the sport. Handspit\u2019s MLB Center features betting news, free picks, stats, odds\u00a0and everything else you\u2019d need to handicap your bets. Checking out a team\u2019s offensive and defensive stats can also aid you in your quest to make great baseball picks.<\/p><p>Analyzing starting pitchers and the bullpen\u2019s fatigue level can help shape your bets. A starting pitcher may have a great start one week but flounder the next time they\u2019re on the mound. We have probable pitcher stats and pitching logs for every pitcher currently in the majors.<\/p><p>Plus, our Consensus page lets you know how the public is betting on each scheduled game. Moreover, our Betting Trends Report can give bettors a snapshot of how to bet. There\u2019s also our Standings page which shows you where each team sits in their respective division. This page is broken down into Money Standings giving you an idea of how much teams are worth as favorites and underdogs, and MLB Standings so you can see how a team performs against lefties and righties. Finally, our Scores page gives you a team\u2019s schedule and, you guessed it, the score of their past games.<\/p><p>Odds can change daily for an MLB game, which can make the nature of sports betting seem erratic. However, if you lock it in to Handspit, you can make good bets and win that Bryce Harper money \u2013 or at least that Jake Taylor money.<\/p>"

And now you have the Jeopardy music stuck in your head. You\u2019re welcome.<\/p><h2>What is the Runline?<\/h2><p>A runline bet is a 1.5-run spread attached to a baseball game. This unique form of baseball betting can be profitable for sports bettors who have done their homework on stats, trends and pitching performances. While a team may be a heavy favorite on the moneyline, that team will own reduced odds when pegged as a 1.5-run favorite. Conversely, teams that are listed as the underdog on the moneyline will see their odds boosted on the runline, by often emerging sometimes as favorites.<\/p><p>While MLB moneyline and totals betting remain the wagering options of choice for many sports bettors, runline betting offers a layer of complexity to the baseball wagering experience. This is particularly true late in the season when a wealth of individual player and team stats, and betting trends are available for analysis.<\/p><h2>The Runline vs The Moneyline<\/h2><p>Let\u2019s use everyone\u2019s favorite example of New York and Boston because those teams are always on TV.<\/p><p>New York -200 Boston +170<\/p><p>In this example, the Yankees are listed as a strong -200 moneyline favorite, meaning a bet on New York to win, by any margin, will cost $200 to win $100. On the other hand, a $100 bet on the Red Sox to win outright will pay $170.<\/p><p>However, in an MLB runline bet on the same hypothetical game, the Yankees are slim +110 underdogs to win by 1.5 runs or more, while the Red Sox are a -140 favorite to not lose by more than one run or win the game.<\/p><p>New York -1.5 +100 Boston +1.5 -140<\/p><p>This means that a $100 runline bet on the Yankees would win $110, while it would cost $140 to win $100 on a bet on the Red Sox to not lose by more than one run.<\/p><h2>A Dramatic Difference in Odds<\/h2><p>The dramatic difference in odds and payouts may be attractive to sports bettors who have studied recent matchups between the two clubs. Using the Handspit Team Reports and MLB Database, you should also take into account the stat splits and recent performances of pitchers using our Pitcher Logs and Pitcher Money Won\/Lost analysis. With the major odds difference, you could see more profit if you place a runline bet instead of a moneyline bet on tonight\u2019s game \u2013 which is probably Yankees vs Red Sox. Cue the Jeopardy music.<\/p>"

                        "content": "<p>The role of the pitcher in baseball has evolved dramatically in recent decades. Starting pitchers once exclusively held the key to success for championship teams, often pitching in eight or more innings per game, and 250-plus innings in a season.<\/p><p>Nowadays, the bullpen has quickly become a crucial part of a team\u2019s World Series aspirations. And like the $5 check your grandma has been sending you on your birthday since you were able to walk, the bullpen can help you build your betting bankroll if you wager strategically.<\/p><h2>Starters Not Going the Distance<\/h2><p>Probable starters are the most important when evaluating five-inning game betting lines. However, it has become somewhat of a rarity for a major league starter to go the distance on a regular basis, with only one pitcher recording more than 10 complete games in a single season since 1998. Can you guess who it is? Here\u2019s a hint: His name rhymes Banes Bields and he was playing for a team from below the Mason-Dixon line at the time.*<\/p><p>Bullpen hurlers have consistently seen their number of innings pitched increase substantially during that same stretch. This makes bullpen evaluation a big part of any successful handicapping strategy.<\/p><p>Many factors come into play when assessing bullpens, and it\u2019s not as simple as collective ERA \u2013 which sounds like it could be the title of an NWA song before Ice Cube left. Bullpen composition is more important than bullpen ERA, while bullpen fatigue can quickly diminish a team\u2019s value on a given night.<\/p><h2>Doing your Bullpen Analysis<\/h2><p>Understanding the overall situation within a team\u2019s bullpen is critical, including knowing which arms are fresh and ready to pitch on a given night.<\/p><p>A club could have a great bullpen ERA with a money closer and solid setup relievers, but if the reliable middle relief arms have worn down from overuse like the soles of a Converse sneaker, or have been getting rocked early, the setup man and closer may never take the mound.<\/p><p>A particular game situation to consider is where a No. 5 starter is taking the mound ahead of a tired bullpen. In such a scenario, the starter may stay in the game longer than usual, giving the bullpen a rest, especially if it\u2019s a gateway game and the team is looking ahead to a key series.<\/p><h2>A Chance for an OVER Wager<\/h2><p>Such circumstances may represent a chance to play the OVER in totals betting, or take a hard look at the opposing team\u2019s moneyline odds, regardless of how long they may appear.<\/p><p>Furthermore, the Handspit in-depth MLB matchup reports can provide you with key background info on how a team\u2019s starters have fared in recent games, while our Pitcher Money Won\/Lost analysis can provide details on how much money that No. 5 starter has produced for his team. No. 5 Starter also sounds like a two-in-one shampoo and conditioner sold at truck stops.<\/p><p>Building your MLB betting bankroll requires an understanding of the strengths of often unheralded hurlers who work out of the bullpen, but who are often responsible for the strong win\/loss records of today\u2019s best starters.<\/p><p>*James Shields, 2011, Tampa Bay Rays<\/p>"

Back in the 2010 MLB season, 20 of baseball\u2019s 86 umpires who worked behind the plate called at least 55 percent\u00a0games that played OVER the total. In other cases, home favorites have enjoyed great success when playing games called by certain umpires.<\/p><h2>Studying Umpire Betting Logs<\/h2><p>While such trends are by the umpire\u2019s design, they are worthy of study by avid baseball bettors. And a useful resource that sports bettors can use to track the performance of umpires is the Handspit MLB Umpire Betting Logs.<\/p><p>Updated daily, this important tool tracks each umpire\u2019s appearance behind the plate, including the home team\u2019s record in games he has called, the overall money earned by the home team against the MLB moneyline in such games, the average number of strikeouts and walks called per game, and the average run total in called games.<\/p><p>If you see a trend in the way an umpire calls the game, take a closer look. If an umpire has an OVER or UNDER streak going, there\u2019s a reason for it, and a reason to include the information in your handicapping approach.<\/p><p>The key is to remember that umpire stats are just another piece to the puzzle.

For those who follow NHL wagering closely, you understand that tracking player injuries, goaltender play and travel schedules, is an important part of your NHL betting strategy. For those who don\u2019t do any of the above but track NHL betting coverage here on Handspit, you\u2019ll still be able to handicap your hockey wagers like you\u2019ve just won the Stanley Cup.<\/p><h2>Betting on the NHL<\/h2><p>Besides your grandma\u2019s mahjong tournament, hockey is one of the most physical and grueling games out there. Depth in hockey is extremely important, especially when teams have to deal with a key injury. Handicapping the NHL schedule is also very critical because teams often play tough stretches both at home and on the road, squeezing a lot of games into short periods of time.<\/p><p>That\u2019s why knowing who\u2019s on the ice and who\u2019s resting is pertinent information you can gather before wagering on hockey games. Whether you bet the moneyline or the puckline, knowing who\u2019s on the ice for each game can determine whether you win or lose your wager.<\/p><h2>Why NHL Travel Schedules Matter<\/h2><p>Handicapping NHL travel schedules will help you stay on the same page as the oddsmakers who are setting the hockey lines. If a team goes on a long road trip, the initial thinking might be to fade them because they will be out of their element for such a long time.<\/p><p>But remember these long road trips are annual occurrences, and like any other time a team hits the road there is opportunity for players to bond and become closer both on and off the ice which can definitely help team chemistry. The key is picking your spots on the schedule when a team might be resting its starting goalie or giving the star player a break during a road trip to avoid running them into the ground.<\/p><p>It\u2019s like a band that goes on a 90-city tour. At first, they\u2019re giving their all and playing the hits but by the time they get to St. Paul on day 87, they\u2019re exhausted and only want to play weird new synth stuff that sounds like a dying whale. You want the NHL teams you\u2019re wagering on to be full of energy and not sounding like dying whales.<\/p><p>You should also consider the following besides fatigue and travel schedules:<\/p><ul class=\"list\"><li class=\"list__item\">How teams perform on nationally televised games<\/li><li class=\"list__item\">How deep a team is on each line<\/li><li class=\"list__item\">How well a goalie performed in their last few games<\/li><li class=\"list__item\">How often a team wins in regulation and how often they go to overtime<\/li><\/ul><h2>Handicapping Postseason Hockey<\/h2><p>The NHL\u2019s Stanley Cup Playoffs are among the most exciting in all of sports. With teams like the 2012 Los Angeles Kings winning the title as an eighth seed, proving all it takes is getting into the postseason to have a shot at the championship. Even your mother could make it to the Stanley Cup Playoffs if she skates hard enough \u2013 well that\u2019s an exaggeration but you get the point.<\/p><p>Because of this, bettors need to be aware that no team is out of any series, with the Zig-Zag Theory serving as a legitimate hockey handicapping strategy to follow. Momentum shifts can happen several times within a seven-game series, just ask your mother when she made it to the Stanley Cup Finals \u2013 again, not a real thing. The best way to handicap the games is to watch them and to stay on top of stats, both basic ones like shots on net and in-depth analytics. We also know that it may be impossible to watch every single moment of the NHL playoffs which is why you need to stay locked in to our NHL Pages.<\/p><p>The following pages will help you handicap your regular and postseason hockey bets:<\/p>Handspit\u2019s NHL Pages<ul class=\"list\"><li class=\"list__item\">Betting News <\/li><li class=\"list__item\">Odds <\/li><li class=\"list__item\">Futures <\/li><li class=\"list__item\">Picks <\/li><li class=\"list__item\">Consensus <\/li><li class=\"list__item\">Database <\/li><li class=\"list__item\">Game Logs <\/li><li class=\"list__item\">Betting Trends <\/li><li class=\"list__item\">Pucklines<\/li><\/ul>"

Whether you were visiting your in-laws in Schenectady for the weekend or sipping ice cold beers on a Caribbean beach for two weeks, by the time your trip is over, you are going to be tired.<\/p><p>NHL travel is like the last day of vacation. The flights are long and players arrive in their opponent\u2019s city bleary-eyed and ready for bed. They have to sleep in a hotel room and hope the bed is as comfortable as theirs is at home. There\u2019s sometimes a border crossing involved where passports have to be presented and players must speak to customs officers about the reason of their travel.<\/p><p>Since oddsmakers account for a team\u2019s travel when setting NHL betting lines, it is essential for bettors to take this into account before making their wagers as well.<\/p><h2>Travel Schedules and NHL Handicapping<\/h2><p>When handicapping hockey games, take into consideration that a tired team just doesn\u2019t have as much in the tank as a rested team.<\/p><h3>Fatigue Impacts Performance<\/h3><p>NHL teams sometimes play three games in four nights, and when they do, they tend to show signs of fatigue by the time the third game rolls around \u2013 especially late in the season when the effects of the schedule are really felt.<\/p><p>Hockey is a physical and grueling sport with NHL teams playing 82 games per season. Couple that with an intense travel schedule and most teams are due for a letdown spot at least once during the season.<\/p><p>While travel fatigue matters, so does the makeup of the team you are handicapping. Do not automatically fade teams based on the fact that they are at the end of a road trip. Fading refers to \u201cbetting against\u201d, not what is happening to the Luc Robitaille jersey you\u2019ve had since you were a kid. It\u2019s hanging on by a thread. Maybe it\u2019s time to stop wearing it?<\/p><p>Anyway, a team with quality depth does not necessarily rely on a handful of key scorers and is better equipped to pull out a victory in these types of situations. Think of the 1991-92 Pittsburgh Penguins who were so deep with talent that even though they traded Paul Coffey and Mark Recchi they still managed to post a 39-32-9 record. Granted they had Mario Lemieux, Kevin Stevens and Joe Mullen who were responsible for a combined 341 points. You know what else had depth in 1992? The movie Sneakers. We\u2019re talking Redford, Kingsley, Poitier, Aykroyd and Phoenix in their primes.<\/p><h3>Keeping Goalies Fresh is Critical<\/h3><p>Goaltending is one of the important factors to consider when handicapping tired teams. Those with elite goaltenders have the potential to steal a game even when their legs are not there. This is usually the case with Canadiens goalie Carey Price.<\/p><p>However, not every team has that luxury. Some teams also have a solid rotation of goalies that can work with them throughout a road trip. For some teams, the backup goalie may be just as good as the starter and rotate together perfectly. This is not the case with Canadiens goalie Carey Price.<\/p><h3>The West has it Bad<\/h3><p>Teams in the Western conference have much longer distances to travel when they hit the road, because it is harder to travel East since you will lose hours due to crossing time zones. Let\u2019s say the Los Angeles Kings are playing the Toronto Maple Leafs. In order to get to Toronto, they not only have to sit on a plane for 5.5 hours and cross the Canadian\/American border, they also have to enter a different time zone which can wreak havoc on the body. This is why you need to know each team\u2019s unique situations regarding their schedule before betting on or against them. One tip is to look at records of West Coast teams when playing in the eastern time zones and East Coast teams playing in western time zones. You can also look at our Betting Trends page for additional handicpapping.<\/p>"

                        "content": "<p>From the preseason to the summer months, where teams stock up on new players and rid their rosters of bad fits, you have different betting options available. The NHL is rife with more bet types than you can shake a stick at \u2013 a hockey stick, obviously. One of these wagering options is the very popular puckline.<\/p><h2>What is a Puckline Bet?<\/h2><p>The puckline is hockey\u2019s version of the point spread and similar to baseball\u2019s runline. For the NHL, oddsmakers give the underdog an advantage of 1.5 goals\u00a0while disadvantaging the favorite by 1.5 goals. The line is adjusted accordingly based on how strong the fave is and how weak the dog is.<\/p><p>The reason this type of NHL bet only uses 1.5\u00a0goals is because hockey games are not high-scoring affairs. The most goals scored by a National Hockey League team is 16, when the Montreal Canadiens put on a clinic over the Quebec Bulldogs in March of 1920. However, this is generally not the case as NHL teams have averaged\u00a02.95 goals per game over the last five years.\u00a0The most common outcome is a 3-2 final.<\/p><h2>How to Read Puckline Odds<\/h2><p>At your sports betting site of choice, puckline odds would look something like this:<\/p><p>Detroit Red Wings -1.5 (-175)<\/p><p>Toronto Maple Leafs +1.5 (+150)<\/p><p>In this scenario, oddsmakers are giving the Leafs padding of 1.5 goals because Toronto would have to win the game outright or not lose by more than two. As for the Red Wings, they would need to win the game by two goals or more to cover their line.<\/p><p>The numbers in brackets are what you use to calculate how much you\u2019d win. Let\u2019s say you were to bet $100 on this game. If you take the Wings at -175 and they did win by two goals, you\u2019d get a payout of $157.14 \u2013 your $100 comes back along with your winnings of $57.14.<\/p><p>If you were to take the other side of that bet, and the Leafs either won the game or didn\u2019t lose by more than two, you\u2019d get $250 \u2013 your original $100 is returned plus\u00a0your winnings of $150.<\/p><p>Our Odds Calculator will show you exactly how much you\u2019d win based on the odds and amount wagered.<\/p><h3>What\u2019s the Difference Between the Puckline and the Moneyline?<\/h3><p>Although\u00a0both betting types have the word \u201cline\u201d in them, they are vastly different. The moneyline requires you to pick a team to win outright, whereas puckline betting relies on goals scored and not on wins and losses.<\/p><p>Another bet that often gets confused with this betting option is a totals wager. This bet requires you to choose if the combined score of both teams will go OVER or UNDER the oddsmaker\u2019s set number, not if a squad will win or lose by two goals.<\/p><h2>When to Bet the Puckline<\/h2><p>There are instances where this kind of betting makes more sense than taking the moneyline or making a totals or spread bet. When there is a strong appeal in wagering on the favorite on the oddsboard and little value on the underdog, a puckline bet could net you more profit. By betting on the favorite to win by two or more goals, you can get the likely winner of the game at a reduced price.<\/p><h3>Hockey Bet Parlays<\/h3><p>This wager combines two or more individual wagers into one bet. Parlays are like smoothies, except you\u2019re not adding protein powder or almond milk, you\u2019re adding a puckline wager on a team to win by two or more goals and\/or any other type of hockey bet. Furthermore, hockey bettors can pair a puckline bet with other NHL bets or even other sports like baseball, football and basketball. However, in order for your parlay bet to cash out, all bets on the ticket need to win.<\/p><p>We have a Parlay Calculator that gives you an idea of what you\u2019d win based on each bet\u2019s odds and total amount wagered. You can add up to 100 bets, but\u00a0we do not recommend creating parlay tickets like that because you are severely hindering your chances of winning.<\/p><h2>Handicapping NHL Betting<\/h2><p>Winning NHL pucklines requires good money management\u00a0and, of course, a little bit of research. The great hockey pages here at Handspit will take care of the research part. Before betting on the NHL, look at our Odds, Betting Trends, Consensus, Offensive and Defensive stats, and Free Picks pages to ensure you\u2019re making an educated wager. We have the handicapping tools needed for you to determine if you\u2019re taking the right side of a two-goal game. It could mean the difference between making Sidney Crosby dollars and Phil Kessel cash*.<\/p><p>*Not an actual unit of currency. Do not go to your bank and ask for 30 Phil Kessels.

A bet on the favorite would give you a payout of $53.08 \u2013 your original $30 is returned along with your winnings of $23.08.<\/p><p>If you were to take the other side of that bet and the underdog wins, you\u2019d see $66 \u2013 you get your $30 back and your prize of $36. The risk associated with Philly is greater, which is why you\u2019d net a bigger payout.<\/p><p>For more info on how much you\u2019d win based on the odds and amount bet, check out our Odds Calculator.<\/p><h3>Moneyline Betting vs Pucklines vs Totals<\/h3><p>The puckline is the point spread of NHL betting. Instead of betting on a team to win the game, you would be wagering on a squad to win by a certain number. This type of spread bet gives the favorite a disadvantage of 1.5 goals and the underdog an advantage of 1.5 goals. Because hockey is a low-scoring sport, and the typical outcome is 3-2, the fave would need to win by two or more goals, and the dog would need to win outright or not lose by more than two goals.<\/p><p>Totals are another way to bet on the National Hockey League, although not as popular as moneylines. As we mentioned above, the typical game result is 3-2. For this kind of bet, you would wager on the total number of goals for both teams. If you believe the score will be more than the oddsmaker\u2019s set number, you would bet the OVER. If you think the score will be less, you would take the UNDER. Action on NHL OVER\/UNDERs isn\u2019t always available at sportsbooks, and when they are, they usually don\u2019t exceed 6.5 goals.<\/p><h2>Moneyline Betting Tips<\/h2><p>While the NHL certainly has dominant teams every season, any team can win on any given night. With an intense schedule that involves major travel, we often forget that hockey players are human beings that need their rest, and not robots who can go for days without stopping. For this reason, huge favorites are not always worth their high price. If a team is -300 and loses, you could put yourself in a serious hole and have some ground to make up. Make sure when betting favorites that you\u2019re not overextending your bankroll.<\/p><p>Besides watching your money, look out for goalies and energy levels.<\/p><h3>Goaltending is Key<\/h3><p>The goaltender is very similar to the quarterback in football, transforming a good team into a great one. The netminder can control the game with his unique style, especially if the defense is sorely lacking. Conversely, a team with a mediocre goalie can cost you a pretty penny if you don\u2019t do your research. Having an in-depth knowledge of a goalie\u2019s stats can give you an edge, especially if you\u2019re going with an underdog squad. Our Team Reports section can help you with this.<\/p><h3>Energy and Fatigue<\/h3><p>Keeping track of team schedules is important when betting the NHL moneyline \u2013 or any hockey wager, for that matter. To make your picks, you\u2019ll need to know who is fresh from a home stretch or who is exhausted after a major swing from west to east where hours are lost to time zones.<\/p><p>Many bettors look to bet against teams on the second night of a back-to-back series, most notably when they are up against teams playing on home ice. Tiredness can impact team performance just the same, and determining which squad has energy to spare, and which one will fall asleep the moment they put on their buckets, can be the difference between winning and losing your moneyline bet.<\/p><p>Winning is always better than losing. Just ask Ron Tugnutt, onetime goalie for the Quebec Nordiques (aka the current Colorado Avalanche). His team went 12-61-7 for the 1989-90 season. That\u2019s way too many losses if you ask us, and we don\u2019t want you to experience that.<\/p><h2>Stanley Cup Moneyline Betting<\/h2><p>During the Finals, many people make moneyline bets since the teams are more evenly matched. This is different than if you were to bet on one team to win the Cup, which would be an NHL futures bet. A future is a wager that can be made as early as the preseason. As soon as there\u2019s hockey buzz, oddsmakers will start listing future odds that are ripe for the betting. It\u2019s better to get in on futures early since the odds will change as teams fall or climb in the standings. On the other hand, Stanley Cup moneylines can be taken up to puckdrop since the odds may not shift at all in the week that they\u2019re set.<\/p><h2>Consensus Odds<\/h2><p>If you need even more handicapping data to make your NHL moneyline picks, check out our Consensus page. Here, you\u2019ll see which side the betting public is taking. We list the odds and show you the percentage of people wagering on each. You can use this information to shape your wagers if you\u2019re on the fence, or more aptly, the red line.<\/p>"

                        "content": "<p>The Zig-Zag Theory is one of the most popular playoff betting strategies among sharp bettors, especially when it comes to wagering on the NBA postseason, but the NHL is not exempt from the idea. The premise behind the Zig-Zag Theory is that in a best-of-seven playoff series, the team coming off a loss is more likely to win the next game regardless of the other variables in play.<\/p><h2>Handicap Series From Game to Game<\/h2><p>Each game of a playoff series is obviously affected by the one that immediately precedes it, with momentum the most important factor to handicap. No team wants to go down 2-0 or 3-1 in a best-of-seven series, stacking the odds against advancing to the next round.<\/p><p>The Zig-Zag Theory applies mainly to a competitive matchup between two fairly even teams, a series that should go six or seven games. Keep in mind, a dominant No. 1 seed coming off a big win in Game 1 over a lowly No. 8 seed is still unlikely to lose at home in Game 2, regardless of what the Zig-Zag Theory says.<\/p><h2>Do Not Follow Zig-Zag Theory Blindly<\/h2><p>In hockey, where home ice does not matter nearly as much as home court in basketball, you will see the Zig-Zag Theory happen more regularly with the Game 1 loser bouncing back to win Game 2 despite playing on the road.<\/p><p>Be cautious as a bettor, though, because no handicapping strategy is flawless and unbeatable. The Zig-Zag Theory is not something that should be followed blindly. If a team has a hot goaltender, it would be unwise to bet against him and his team, even if the Zig-Zag Theory has you pointing in the other direction. At the same time, injuries can also take their toll on a team and prevent them from rebounding after a tough loss.<\/p><h2>Bet Each Playoff Series Carefully<\/h2><p>The best thing to do as a bettor is watch as many NHL playoff games as you can and follow each series as closely as possible. Each postseason matchup is different, and there is always the possibility that other intangibles will come into play and impact the series more anyway.<\/p><p>Sometimes when a coach has the other team figured out, there will be no \u201cZig-Zag\u201d to follow because he can help his players prevent any change of momentum. And if one team simply has the other\u2019s number, you can toss handicapping strategies like this out the window to avoid throwing your money away.<\/p><p>Just be aware that the Zig-Zag Theory is worth monitoring and could help you win NHL bets.<\/p>"

                        "content": "<p>In terms of combat sports, nothing beats the UFC. Get it? Beats! Dad joke alert! Anyway, UFC odds have long enticed bettors to wager on their favorite fighters in order to make some coin. In order to bet on the UFC, you need a basic understanding of the sport and fighters, and you need to learn how to read the odds. Handspit\u2019s got you covered like two fighters locked in a clinch.<\/p><h2>How to Read UFC Odds<\/h2><p>Most sports odds are presented in the same way. The favorite is represented by the minus sign (-), while the underdog is represented by the plus sign (+). You\u2019ll also notice that odds are usually based on bettors wagering $100. When you see +110 or -110, it means that the juice or vig \u2013 what the sportsbook collects \u2013 is $10. Sportsbooks have to make money in order to be able to operate and the juice is usually in the $5-$10 range.<\/p><p>For example, you may see odds for a fight between Conor McGregor and Khabib Nurmagomedov shown like this:<\/p><p>McGregor +125<\/p><p>Nurmagomedov -155<\/p><p>If you decided to bet the favorite (Nurmagomedov), you would need to lay down $155 to win $100. Conversely, if you bet the underdog (McGregor), you would only need to lay down $100 to win $125. Underdog bets come with more risk, which is why you don\u2019t have to put up as much money as you would with a bet on the favorite. Something to note, you don\u2019t have to bet $100 on the game. You can wager whatever you like, depending on the sportsbook.<\/p><p>Kudos to you if you can spell \u201cNurmagomedov\u201d on your first try. Some of us had to look it up.<\/p><h2>UFC Betting Explained<\/h2><p>When it comes to wagering on this combat sport, you have many options like the moneyline, method of victory, and total rounds.<\/p><p>UFC moneyline betting simply comes down to betting on who you believe is going to win the fight. For example, Conor McGregor was a -140 favorite for his fight vs Eddie Alvarez at UFC 205. To win $100, you would need to wager $140 on McGregor. Yet, Alvarez was the +110 underdog, which means you would only need to wager $100 to win $110.<\/p><p>The method of victory bet is a wager you place on how the fight will be won instead of who will win it. Using the same example of UFC 205, if you believe McGregor will win via knockout \u2013 which he did \u2013 that would be your method of victory bet.<\/p><p>A total rounds wager is similar to an OVER\/UNDER bet you would make on any other sport but instead of guessing if the points total will be less or more than the amount set by the sportsbook, you would bet the number of rounds. If you think the fight between McGregor and Nurmagomedov will be over in 2.5 rounds or less, you would bet the UNDER. If you think the fight will go more than 2.5 rounds, you would bet the OVER.<\/p><h2>UFC Betting Tactics<\/h2><p>The straightforward nature of UFC betting leads to straightforward handicapping and strategy as well. UFC bettors are tasked with picking winners, how a fight will end, and how long it will go on. In order to make smart bets, you\u2019ll need to do your homework. The only difference between doing your homework now vs when you were in high school is that\u00a0UFC homework can win you some money. If only that were the case when you were a teenager, although you probably would\u2019ve spent your homework reward money on Nine Inch Nails CDs like some of us did thinking they were going to start the goth revolution.<\/p><p>Moving on. The great UFC fighters are versatile, but regardless of how good a fighter is, he or she is going to have strengths and weaknesses. These show up in the style that the fighter employs. A powerful striker is going to try to keep the fight off the mat and win with punches and kicks. A grappler is going to try to get the fight down to the mat and win by submission.<\/p><p>Bettors should take the time to learn and understand the different styles presented by each fighter and how they play off each other. While a fighter will usually be able to dictate the pace of a fight, one vulnerable weakness against the wrong opponent could send a favorite to a bitter loss and pay off a nice underdog wager.<\/p><h2>Where to Bet on the UFC<\/h2><p>If you\u2019re serious about UFC betting, you\u2019ll want to check out different sportsbooks to see which ones offer the best odds.

F1\u2019s popularity has been\u00a0steadily\u00a0growing in America, and with that popularity comes additional betting interest.<\/p><h2>Basic Odds and Betting Options<\/h2><p>Formula 1\u00a0Grand Prix events are usually separated by a span of one to three weeks throughout the course of the season. The most standard type of wager on these races is simply a bet on which driver will win the race.<\/p><p>There is usually a clear favorite such as Lewis Hamilton going off at something like -150 to win the race (bet $150 to win $100) while others in the field go off at anywhere from +200 (bet $100 to win $200) up to astronomical odds of 5000-to-1 on the huge underdogs.<\/p><p>Some sportsbooks offer additional prop bets on a race-by-race basis including which car will win the race or what country the winner will hail from. Bettors can also bet on who will win the Formula 1\u00a0drivers\u00a0championship, which is decided based on the aggregate score of the entire season at the end of the year.<\/p><h2>Formula 1\u00a0Betting Strategies<\/h2><p>While the huge payouts on the underdogs may look tempting, they are usually a waste of time. Formula 1 is a sport in which the favorites almost always get the job done. In 2017, Lewis Hamilton\u00a0won nine races on\u00a0the season while his Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas won three, giving Hamilton the drivers\u00a0championship and Mercedes the constructors\u00a0championship. Back in 2014, only three drivers were able to earn wins all season long: Hamilton (11), Nico Rosberg (5) and Daniel Ricciardo (3).<\/p><p>Generally there are only going to be about four to six cars and drivers that have a realistic chance of winning on any given race day. One way to find value is to avoid overvaluing the pole position.<\/p><p>Earning the pole does give the driver in the lead a big advantage over the field as he is able to navigate the course without any cars ahead of him from the get-go. But despite this advantage, the driver with pole position only wins about 40 to 50 percent\u00a0of the time. While this is significant, it isn\u2019t necessarily worth paying huge chalk for.<\/p><p>Oftentimes there is more value to be found in betting on an excellent driver off of the pole at +300 or +800 instead of always betting on the huge favorite who starts with pole position.<\/p><h2>Finding a Suitable Sportsbook<\/h2><p>Because Formula 1\u00a0racing is\u00a0a niche sport in the United States, some sportsbooks don\u2019t offer any betting options for it outside of simply who is going to win the race. If you are interested in betting on Formula 1\u00a0racing, you will definitely want to shop around.<\/p><p>Look for a sportsbook that not only gives you more betting options\u00a0but also gives you the best price on your wagers. The difference between betting a winner at +225 or +300 can add up in a hurry.<\/p>"

From betting on players to win the tournament to betting on individual matches, value can be found all over the place for the astute tennis bettor. Handicappers willing to put in the time and effort can make good money betting on tennis.<\/p><h2>Basic Odds and Betting Options<\/h2><p>There are many ways to bet on tennis. The most straightforward bets are on individual matches. A match between two players who are fairly even in skill will be close in odds on both sides such as Novak Djokovic going off at -205 (bet $205 to win $100) against Andy Murray at +175 (bet $100 to win $175).<\/p><p>On the other hand, Djokovic going up against a much less talented opponent could be a huge favorite of -5000 (bet $5000 to win $100) while his opponent would be going off at something like +1600 (bet $100 to win $1600). In matches like this, spreads are usually offered, giving bettors the chance to bet Djokovic to win in straight sets or his opponent to steal a set at more even prices.<\/p><p>Most tournaments also have wagers available on who will win the tournament. So instead of betting on individual matches, a bettor could just take Djokovic to win the U.S. Open at +100 or Roger Federer at +600. The \u201cBig Four\u201d of Djokovic, Murray, Federer\u00a0and Rafael Nadal are usually the betting favorites in every tournament in which they participate.<\/p><h2>Tennis Betting Strategies<\/h2><p>Finding upsets on the tournament win level can be difficult, as it is almost always an elite player who wins the major tournaments when everything is said and done. But on the individual match level, bettors who put in the time to study can find big edges on dominant favorites and live underdogs.<\/p><p>One element of tennis handicapping to consider is the style of each player. Many beginners just get caught up on names and records instead of actually breaking down a match by how the two players play.<\/p><p>For example, John Isner is a very effective tennis player due to his powerful serve. Against opponents with an average or subpar return game, he is going to be virtually unbeatable. But against a great returner, Isner is vulnerable. Learn the strengths and weaknesses of various players to determine where they are good or bad bets.<\/p><p>Surface is also important. Players like Nadal and David Ferrer are substantially better on clay than they are on other surfaces. Be sure to factor surface into your betting decisions.<\/p><h2>Finding a Suitable Sportsbook<\/h2><p>For casual tennis bettors, most sportsbooks will be about the same, offering betting lines on tournament winners and individual matches.<\/p><p>But for the more avid tennis bettors, when lines are released and what additional prop bets are available (such as betting on exact scores or set totals) will be a big deal. Compare multiple sportsbooks to see which betting options they have available on tennis matches around the world.<\/p>"
