# Styling

Vuesence Book can be styled using CSS. As an example there are two CSS files in the repository as an example - vuepress-style.css and google-style.css - that simulate look-and-feel of [Vuepress book](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/) and [Google doc system](https://developers.google.com/web/ilt/pwa).
